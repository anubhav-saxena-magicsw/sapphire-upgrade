<p>&#x2018;Preparation of group consolidated financial statements&#x2019; is an important topic in your examination as one question of 40 marks is based on it. You may work for multinational corporations at some point in your career, and so you will need to have a thorough understanding of the concept, principles and techniques of consolidation.</p>
<p>You may wonder why there is need for preparing consolidated accounts. The purpose is to show the financial statements of a group of companies together as if the group was one single entity.</p>
<p>Consolidation of accounts does not mean merely adding together like items in the financial statements of the group companies. For example, if the sales of the parent company are $30,000 and that of the subsidiary are $20,000 then one would assume that consolidated sales are $50,000 ($30,000 + $20,000). This would be true if there are no intra-group transactions but if the sales of the parent company include sales of $5,000 to the subsidiary then is it correct to say that consolidated sales are $50,000? Can the group sell $5,000 to itself? The answer is no and this Study Guide will teach you how to make these adjustments and others.</p>
<p>In this Study Guide you will be introduced to the concept of a group; understand the meaning of parent and subsidiary. A study of this Study Guide will equip you to make adjustments mentioned above and leave you in a position where you will be able to prepare consolidated financial statements of a simple group with confidence and ease.</p>
