<p>Financial Instrument being a complex area, the International Accounting Standards Board planned amending the IAS 39 Financial Instrument in stages. The IASB planned this project to be completed in three phases:</p>
<p>Phase I: Classification and measurement<br/>
Phase II: Impairment<br/> 
Phase III: Hedge Accounting</p>
<p>The above three phases were completed at various points of time. The previous versions of IFRS 9 Financial Instruments have now been superseded by the version released in July 2014 which covers the amendments made in the three phases.</p>
<p>To summarise there are currently three major standards dealing on the topic of financial instruments which include:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Standards dealing with financial instruments</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p142-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>All the above standards have been discussed throughout this Study Guide.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Definition of financial instrument</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">financial instrument </span>is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.</p>
</div>
<p>A <span class="bold">contract </span>is an agreement between two or more parties which the parties cannot avoid as it is usually enforceable by law. A contract has clear economic consequences. It is important to note that <span class="bold">contracts </span>need not be in writing. A contractual right or contractual obligation to receive, deliver or exchange financial instruments is itself a financial instrument.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rohan deposited $100,000 in a bank.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The deposit of cash is a financial asset, as it represents the contractual right of Rohan to obtain cash or draw a cheque from the bank. Equally it is a financial liability in the Bank&#x2019;s financial statements as the bank has to pay the money back to Rohan at some point when Rohan requests it.</p>
</div>
<p>To understand what financial instruments are, we need to know the terms <span class="bold">&#x2018;financial assets&#x2019;, &#x2018;financial liabilities&#x2019;, &#x2018;equity instruments&#x2019; and &#x2018;derivatives&#x2019;.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span></span>The terms <span class="bold">&#x2018;financial asset&#x2019;, &#x2018;financial liability&#x2019;,</span> <span class="bold">and </span><span class="bold">&#x2018;equity instrument&#x2019; </span>are defined by IAS 32 &#x2018;Financial Instruments : Presentation&#x2019; as follows:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Any of the following assets is a <span class="bold">financial asset </span>of an entity:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span><span class="bold">Cash</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>An <span class="bold">equity instrument of another entity</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">c) </span>A <span class="bold">contractual right</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>to receive <span class="bold">cash </span>or <span class="bold">another financial asset </span>from another entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>to <span class="bold">exchange financial assets or financial liabilities </span>with another entity under conditions that is potentially favourable to the entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">d) </span>A contract that will or may be settled in the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments and is</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>That is a <span class="bold">non-derivative </span>for which the entity is or may be obliged to <span class="bold">receive a variable number of its own equity instruments. </span>or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>A derivative that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a fixed number of the entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Any of the following becomes a <span class="bold">financial liability </span>of an entity:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span></span>A <span class="bold">contractual obligation:</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>to deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another entity under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span></span>A <span class="bold">contract </span>that will or may be settled in the <span class="bold">entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments and is:</span></p>

<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>A <span class="bold">derivative </span>that will or may be settled other than by the exchange of a fixed amount of cash or another financial asset for a <span class="bold">fixed number </span>of the <span class="bold">entity&#x2019;s own equity instruments.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Some common examples of financial assets and corresponding financial liabilities representing a contractual right / obligation to receive / deliver cash in the future are:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Trade accounts receivable and payable</li>
<li>Loans receivable and payable</li>
<li>Bonds receivable and payable</li>
</ul>
<p>Liabilities or assets that are not contractual are not financial liabilities or financial assets. These would include taxes, which are the result of statutory requirements.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Remember assets and liabilities relating to taxes that are a result of statutory requirements imposed by governments are not financial instruments, as there is no contract between the government and an entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">equity instrument </span>is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.</p>
</div>
<p>In simple terms, an equity instrument of company A gives a person a share of the equity of company A.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Ordinary shares issued by a company are examples of equity instruments.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">derivative </span>is a financial instrument or other contract within the scope of IFRS 9, with all three of the following characteristics:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Its <span class="bold">value changes </span>in response to a change in a specified interest rate, financial instrument price, commodity price, foreign exchange rate, index of prices or rates, credit rating or credit index, or other variable provided in the case of a non-financial variable that the variable is not specific to a party to the contract(known <span class="bold">as the underlying item</span>).</li>
<li>It requires <span class="bold">no initial net investment or an initial net investment </span>that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors.</li>
<li>It is settled at a future date.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Baron Co enters into a contract. Under this contract, Baron Co will pay $5,000 if XYZ&#x2019;s share price increases by $10 or more during an eight-month period; it will receive $5,000 if the share price decreases by $10 or more during the same eight-month period; and no payment will be made if the price swing is less than $10 up or down.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, the settlement amount changes with XYZ&#x2019;s share price. Although there is no notional amount to determine the settlement amount, there is a payment provision that is based on changes. All the other characteristics of a derivative mentioned above (the <span class="bold">value of an instrument changes, no initial investment is needed and it can be settled at a future date</span>) are also present.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the contract entered into by Baron Co is a <span class="bold">derivative.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Different types of derivatives are:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Forwards </span>are contracts to purchase or sell a specific quantity of a financial instrument with delivery or settlement on a pre-agreed future date. These are over-the-counter contracts.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Interest rate swaps </span>are contracts to exchange cash flows as of specified dates based on a notional amount.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Futures </span>are similar to forward contracts. These are exchange-traded contracts.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Options </span>are contracts that give the purchaser the right, but not the obligation to buy or sell a specified quantity of a particular financial instrument.</li>

<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A flour milling company enters into a forward contract to buy 1,000 tonnes of wheat in 6 months' time, at an agreed price. The contract can either be settled by delivery of wheat to the company's mill, or by a cash payment representing the difference between the forward price and the spot price of the wheat on the delivery date. If can be argued that IFRS 9 would be applicable to this transaction, since it can be settled net in cash.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, the contracts those were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of a non-financial item in accordance with the entity&#x2019;s expected purchase, sale or usage requirements are excluded from the scope of IFRS 9. Looking at the facts, it appears that the transaction is entered into for the purpose of acquiring wheat for the usage at the mill. Hence, this transaction would be out of the scope of IFRS 9</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. IAS 32 states that the following items are not financial instruments:</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Physical assets </span>(such as inventories, property, plant and equipment), leased assets and intangible assets (such as patents and trademarks).</p>
<p>Physical and intangible assets are not financial instruments because they help generate a <span class="bold">future </span>inflow of cash or another financial asset, but do not give rise to a <span class="bold">present right </span>to receive cash or another financial asset.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Assets such as pre-paid expenses </span>(expenses that are to be paid in advance are called pre-paid expenses).</p>
<p>Assets such as pre-paid expenses are not financial instruments because they help generate a future economic benefit:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>in the form of the receipt of goods or services; <span class="bold">and not</span></li>
<li>in the form of the right to receive cash or another financial asset.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">3. Financial instruments which fall outside the scope of IAS 32 </span>(each of these items is covered by its own separate accounting standard)</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>obligations arising under insurance contracts</li>
<li>interests in subsidiaries</li>
<li>interests in associates</li>
<li>interests in joint ventures</li>
<li>employee benefit plans</li>
<li>Contracts and obligations under share based payment transactions</li>
</ul>
<p>These financial instruments are recognised and measured according to the provisions of standards which deal specifically with them.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Classification of financial assets</span></p>
<p>Under IFRS 9, all financial assets should be classified into the following three categories:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Designation of financial assets</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p145-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Amortised cost</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">A </span><span class="bold">financial asset at amortised cost </span>is a financial asset other than an equity instrument that meets the following conditions:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>&#x2018;Hold-to-collect&#x2019; business model test: </span>the asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>&#x2018;SPPI&#x2019; contractual cash flow characteristics test: </span>the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this IFRS, interest represents consideration for the time value of money and for the credit risk associated with the principal amount outstanding during a particular period of time.</p>
<p>Note: Although a financial asset may satisfy the amortised costs classification, they may be measured at fair value. This option can be invoked by the entity at the inception and can be used to avoid any accounting mismatch.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Guidance for determining the business model:</span></p>
<p>The entity&#x2019;s business model does not depend on management&#x2019;s intentions for an individual instrument. Accordingly, this condition is not an instrument-by-instrument approach to classification and should be determined on a higher level of aggregation. Further, a single entity may have more than one business model for managing its financial instruments. Therefore, classification need not be determined at the reporting entity level. For example, an entity may hold a portfolio of investments that it manages in order to collect contractual cash flows and another portfolio of investments that it manages in order to trade and realise fair value changes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Brick Co purchases portfolios of loans. If payment on the loans is not received on a timely basis, the entity attempts to extract the contractual cash flows through various means&#x2014;for example, by contacting the vendor by mail, telephone or other methods. In some cases, the entity enters into interest rate swaps to change the interest rate on particular financial assets in a portfolio from a floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The objective of the entity&#x2019;s business model is to hold the financial assets and collect the contractual cash flows. The entity does not purchase the portfolio of investments to make profit by selling them.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Moreover, the fact that the entity has entered into interest rate swaps to modify the cash flows of the portfolio does not in itself change the entity&#x2019;s business model. If the portfolio is not managed on a trading basis, the objective of the business model could be to hold the assets to collect the contractual cash flows.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Fair value through OCI</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) Debt instruments at FVOCI</span></p>
<p>A financial instrument must be classified and measured at fair value through OCI if it meets both the following criteria:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">i. </span>&#x2018;Hold-to-collect and sell&#x2019; business model test: </span>the asset is held within a business model whose objective is achieved by both holding financial assets in order to collect contractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>&#x2018;SPPI&#x2019; contractual cash flow characteristics test: </span>the contractual terms of the financial asset give rise to cash flows on specific dates that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.</p>
<p>The likely financial instruments that could be classified at Fair value through OCI include financial assets like government bonds / corporate bonds that we intend to hold for a long period (but not necessarily up to maturity).</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Equity investments at FVOCI</span></p>
<p>Equity investments that are not held for trading, can be classified at FVOCI if during initial recognition, the entity <span class="bold">makes an irrevocable election to classify the instruments as at FVOCI. </span>This election is available for each separate investment.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Financial assets measured at fair value through profit and loss (i.e. FVTPL)</span></p>
<p>Financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss if they are not held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets to collect contractual cash flows or within a business model whose objective is achieved by both collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets. A financial asset shall be measured at fair value unless it is measured at amortised cost.</p>
<p>The following financial assets are likely to be classified under this category:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>A held-for-trading financial asset</li>
<li>A debt instrument that cannot be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI</li>
<li>An equity investment which the entity has not made <span class="bold">an irrevocable election </span>to classify as at FVOCI</li>
<li>Derivatives that have not been designated in a hedging relationship</li>
<li>Investments in convertible notes, commodity linked bonds </li>
<li>Contingent consideration receivable from the sale of a business.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alpha limited invests in listed shares of Beta Ltd. Since this is an equity investment, the concept of contractual cash flows - to receive on specific dates the principal and interest on the principal - does not apply. Hence, the investment is considered as financial asset measured at fair value unless during initial recognition, Alpha <span class="bold">makes an irrevocable election to classify the instruments as at FVOCI .</span></p>
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 3: Steps to classify financial assets</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p147-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Note: </span>Derivatives are always classified as &quot;FVPL (Fair value through PL)</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Classification of financial liabilities</span></p>
<p>Under IFRS 9, all financial liabilities should be classified into either of the two categories:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 4: Designation of financial liabilities</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p148-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss</span></p>
<p>Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value with the value changes being recorded in profit or loss. The measurement of fair value is in accordance with IFRS 15 air value measurement.</p>
<p>IFRS 9 provides that the fair value through profit or loss classification can be opted if:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>It reduces or eliminates recognition inconsistency (referred to as an 'accounting mismatch') that would arise on measuring or recognising gain or loss on financial liability on some different basis or</li>
<li>the liability is part of a group of financial liabilities or financial assets and financial liabilities and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented risk management or investment strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost</span></p>
<p>Financial liabilities are measured at amortised cost unless either:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The financial liability is classified as FVTPL as it is held for trading (for example derivatives that are not designated in a hedging relationship); or</li>
<li>The entity elects to classify the financial liability at FVTPL, based on the criteria discussed in the above paragraph. (for example deposits from customers and debt instruments issued).</li>
</ul>
<p>An entity shall classify all financial liabilities as subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, except for financial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss.</p>
<p>Generally, deposits from customers and issued debt instruments are classified under this category.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity has financed a specified group of loans by issuing traded bonds whose changes in fair value tend to offset each other. The entity regularly buys and sells these bonds. However, it rarely, buys and sells the loans. Reporting both the loans and the bonds at fair value through profit or loss eliminates the inconsistency in the timing of recognition of gains and losses that would otherwise result from measuring them both at amortised cost and recognising a gain or loss each time a bond is repurchased.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Account for debt instruments, equity instruments and the allocation of finance costs.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2.1 </span></span>The classification of a financial instrument as debt or equity primarily depends upon whether there is an obligation on the issuer:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 5: Classification of a financial instrument as debt or equity</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p149-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>If there <span class="bold">is no </span>such <span class="bold">obligation, </span>then the financial instrument is an <span class="bold">equity instrument.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">When an entity issues <span class="bold">ordinary shares,</span> it is possible that it will declare a dividend. However, there is no compulsion to do so. The entity is <span class="bold">under no obligation </span>to deliver cash or another financial asset to the ordinary shareholders, or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with the holder under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the issuer.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This means that <span class="bold">the ordinary shares </span>are <span class="bold">equity instruments </span>of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>If there <span class="bold">is </span>such an <span class="bold">obligation, </span>then the financial instrument is a <span class="bold">debt instrument.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">When <span class="bold">debentures </span>are issued by an entity, it has to pay the agreed amount of interest.</p>
<p class="boxpara">At the end of the maturity period, the entity must repay the debenture holders either in cash or by issuing some other financial instrument. All these terms are included in the terms of issue and are binding upon the entity. The entity is <span class="bold">under an obligation </span>to deliver cash or another financial asset to the debenture holders. </p>
<p class="boxpara">This means that <span class="bold">the debentures </span>are <span class="bold">debt instruments </span>of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>It is essential to consider the <span class="bold">substance of the obligation rather than the legal form. </span>There could be instances where the instrument is actually a debt instrument but with the outward appearance of an equity instrument.</p>
<p>Each category of financial instruments issued by an entity has to be assessed carefully in order to determine its classification. This becomes necessary because an improper classification will lead to a misrepresentation in the financial statements.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Brand Co issues 10% preference shares with a fixed interest rate and a redemption clause.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The legal term used in this transaction is &#x2018;preference shares&#x2019; which reflects the fact that it is an equity instrument in form.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The substance of the transaction is that Brand Co is obliged to:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Payment of fixed interest; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>redeem the preference shares at a particular date</p>
<p class="boxpara">The substance of the transaction shows that it is a debt instrument.<br/>
Hence, the form of the transaction is different from the substance.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>If the shares are irredeemable and the holders of the shares do not have a right to ask for redemption, such shares would be classified under equity, since there is no obligation on the company issuing these irredeemable shares to repay the amount.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Other main differences between debt capital and equity capital</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Holders of equity instruments are the legal owners of the entity. They receive dividends, which are an appropriation of its post-tax profits.</li>
<li>Debt instruments represent an entity&#x2019;s borrowed capital. The interest / dividends paid to holders of debt instruments are a charge against its pre-tax profits. This is tax usually deductible expenditure for the company.(depending upon the local tax laws)</li>
</ul>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Explain the measurement issues relating to financial instruments.</span><a href="videos/Financial Instruments_Part2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Initial measurement of financial instruments</span></p>
<p>A financial instrument can be recognised when the contractual obligations become binding on both entities involved in the transaction. Discussions do not become a binding contract. A planned purchase cannot be recognised as a financial asset.</p>
<p>When a financial asset or financial liability is recognised initially, an entity shall measure it at its fair value plus/minus transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the financial asset or financial liability except for a financial asset or financial liability classified as &#x2018;at fair value through profit or loss&#x2019;.</p>
<p>For financial instruments measured at amortised cost, and financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs are included in the calculation of amortised cost using the effective interest method and, in effect, amortised through profit or loss over the life of the instrument.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Dolla Co issued bond for$30,000, to be measured at amortised cost. Issuance costs are $600. In this case it should be recognised at $29,400 ($30,000 - $600) i.e. net of transaction costs.</p>
</div>
<p>Transaction costs expected to be incurred on transfer or disposal of a financial instrument are not included in the measurement of the financial instrument.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Initial recognition of financial liabilities</span></p>
<p>When a financial liability is recognised initially, an entity shall measure it at its fair value minus, in the case of a financial liability not at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the issue of the financial liability. All financial liabilities <span class="bold">designated </span><span class="bold">as &#x2018;at fair value through profit or loss&#x2019; are initially </span><span class="bold">measured at their fair values.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Transaction costs should be deducted from the Fair Value of liabilities in the initial measurement of financial liabilities other than those at fair value through profit or loss.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Transaction costs for &#x2018;at amortised cost&#x2019; financial liabilities should be capitalized, i.e. deducted from the initial value, on initial recognition. If the financial liability has fixed or determinable payments, the transaction costs are amortised to profit or loss using the effective interest method.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Speciality Co purchased 500 shares of Quality for $12,000. For this, Speciality incurred broker fees of $120.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The journal entries to record the transaction will depend on the classification:</p>
<p class="boxpara">If Specialty holds the shares for trading, it has to classify the shares as at fair value through profit or loss, and the journal entries would be (on initial recognition):</p>

<p class="boxpara">If the shares are not held for trading and Specialty wishes to classify the shares at FVTOCI, the entry would be:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p151-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Initial recognition of financial assets</span></p>
<p>When a financial asset is recognised, an entity shall initially measure it in the following manner:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>for a financial assets at fair value through profit or loss: <span class="bold">at fair value</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>for a financial assets <span class="bold">not </span>at fair value through profit or loss: <span class="bold">at its fair value plus the transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset</span></p>
<p>If redeemable preference shares and debt instruments with no conversion rights are not to be recognised at fair value through profit or loss, then all <span class="bold">transaction costs directly attributable </span>to the <span class="bold">acquisition </span>will be <span class="bold">added to </span>their <span class="bold">fair value.</span></p>
<p>For determining fair values of financial instruments, IFRS 13 Fair value measurements gives guidance:</p>
<p>IFRS 13 specifies the ranking for inputs based on which fair value is to be determined; it does not specify the measurement technique as it will differ according to circumstances.</p>
<p>The hierarchies of inputs are to be followed in sequence.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Level 1 Inputs: </span>Quoted price for identical asset or liability, if this price is available use it for calculating fair value. Example: Prices of listed shares.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Level 2 inputs: </span>If level 1 inputs are not available we need to consider level 2 inputs for fair value measurement. These inputs include observable inputs other than quoted prices. Example: Valuation of fixed income securities like interest rate swaps, which use information like LIBOR or other observable inputs.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Level 3 inputs: </span>These inputs include non-observable inputs. This is the option of last resort, if no inputs for level 1 or Level 2 are available level 3 inputs are to be used. Example: Value of Non-current assets whose prices are usually not determinable in market. Comparable information like price of a property sold in the similar area is used as a non-observable input.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">James purchased unquoted shares with a face value of $30,500 for $60,000 from his friend. He intends to sell them as soon as a favourable sale can be made.</p>
<p class="boxpara">As these shares fall under the category of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, they are to be recognised at their fair value. As the shares are unquoted, market prices are not available and if a reliable estimate of the fair value is not possible, IFRS 9 provides guidance as to when cost will be best estimate of fair value. If the conditions laid down in IFRS 9 are fulfilled, the shares can be recognised at cost, i.e. $60,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Subsequent measurement of financial instruments</span></p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that financial instruments are classified into one of two categories. Following their initial recognition, this classification determines how the financial instrument is subsequently measured.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Financial instruments measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">amortised cost of a financial asset or financial liability </span>is the amount at which the financial asset or financial liability is measured at initial recognition minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and for financial assets, adjusted for any loss allowance.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">effective interest method </span>is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset or a financial liability (or group of financial assets or financial liabilities) and of allocating the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">effective interest rate </span>is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial asset or financial liability to the gross carrying amount of a financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, an entity shall estimate the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but shall not consider the expected credit losses.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 1 January 20X4, Tail Co issued bonds worth $400,000. The transaction costs directly attributable to the issue are $20,000. The rate of interest is 6% payable annually and the bonds will be redeemed on 31 December 20X7 for $485,000. The effective interest rate is 12%.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, the bonds will be initially recognised at proceeds received less transaction cost:</p>

The carrying amount of bonds is increased each year by the finance cost and reduced by any payments made to the holders of the bonds.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p153-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p>A <span class="bold">gain or loss </span>on account of <span class="bold">subsequent measurement </span>is <span class="bold">recognised in profit or loss </span>only when the <span class="bold">financial asset is impaired or the financial asset </span>or <span class="bold">financial liability </span>is <span class="bold">derecognised</span></p>
<p>However, <span class="bold">interest calculated </span>using <span class="bold">the effective interest method </span>is <span class="bold">recognised in profit or loss every year.</span></p>
<p>An entity is required to assess, on each reporting date, whether, in objective terms, a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial asset measured at amortised cost is said to be impaired when its carrying value exceeds the present value of the future cash flows (discounted at the financial asset&#x2019;s original effective interest rate).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss </span>are measured at their <span class="bold">fair values without any deduction </span>for <span class="bold">transaction costs </span>that may be <span class="bold">incurred on sale or disposal.</span></p>
<p>A gain or loss on account of subsequent measurement is recognised in profit or loss (Except in few cases mentioned below). Dividends and interests received / receivable (in case of financial assets) or paid / payable (in case of financial liabilities) are recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<p>The method of determination of fair value for subsequent measurement will be consistent with the method used at the time of initial measurement.</p>
<p>Note that derivatives and financial liabilities that are held for trading are always classified under this category. Furthermore and all fair value changes will be measured through Profit and Loss.</p>
<p>The value changes in other financial liabilities are recognised as follows:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 6: Recognition of value changes in other financial liabilities</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p153-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>On de-recognition any gain or losses in the OCI are not reclassified to profit or loss. They may be transferred within equity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alpha Plc issued a bond and classified the liability at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). At the end of the financial reporting period, there is a decrease in the fair value of the bond, to the extent of $5,000; out of which $2,000 related to credit risk. The change in the credit risk is not expected to create any accounting mismatch.</p>
<p class="boxpara">How should Alpha account for the fair value change?</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p154-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Financial instruments measured at fair value through OCI</span></p>
<p>For equity instruments not held for trading, for which an irrevocable election has been made at the time of initial recognition to recognise subsequent changes in the fair value in other comprehensive income, the gain or loss on re-measurement is recognized in OCI, with dividends from that investment being recognized in profit or loss when the entity&#x2019;s right to receive payment of the dividend is established.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Omega Ltd acquires an asset for $100,000 plus a purchase commission of $2,000. Initially, Omega Ltd classifies the assets as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and recognises the asset at $102,000. The reporting period ends one day later, when the quoted market price of the asset is $100,000. If the asset were sold, a commission of $3,000 would be paid. On that date, Omega Ltd measures the asset at $100,000 (without regard to the possible commission on sale) and recognises a loss of $2,000 in other comprehensive income.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore commission paid on sale of financial assets does not affect the valuation of the asset on the reporting date.</p>

<p><span class="bold">De-recognition </span>is the term used for the removal of a previously recognised financial asset (or financial liability) from an entity&#x2019;s statement of financial position. De-recognition of a financial asset occurs when the contractual rights to the cash flows of the financial asset have expired or the financial asset has been transferred. As de-recognition and initial recognition are connected issues, the principle for discontinuing the recognition of a financial asset or liability should be consistent with the principle for recognition.</p>

</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. Account for fixed interest rate and convertible bonds.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Fixed interest rate</span></p>
<p>Debt instruments represent an entity&#x2019;s borrowed capital. It is mandatory for a company to pay interest on these financial instruments.</p>
<p>The interest paid to the holders of debt instruments is a charge against their pre-tax profits and has to be shown as an expense in the statement of profit or loss, as it is tax deductible expenditure for the company</p>
<p>The effective interest method is applied to instruments that have fixed payments and a fixed term. It has been discussed in Learning Outcome c.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 Compound financial instruments</span></p>
<p>Compound financial instruments are instruments that contain both a debt element and an equity element. A convertible bond is an example of a compound instrument, since it has a debt element and a potential equity element (on conversion). The economic effect of issuing the convertible bond is the same as issuing anon-convertible bond and an option to purchase shares. The value of the convertible bond should therefore be split into its component parts to show the <span class="bold">substance </span>of the instrument. An entity should estimate the fair value of the component parts.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Melon Co has issued 5% debentures for $500,000. The debenture holders have the option of converting these debentures into ordinary shares at a premium of 25% at the end of four years.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.1 What is hedge accounting</span></p>
<p>Entities face many business risks and the most significant risk is financial risk. Different companies are exposed to different types of financial risks such as risks related to interest rates or exchange rates. Entities use a risk management technique called <span class="bold">hedging, </span>whereby the entity tries to reduce the impact of future potential costs or losses.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Arson Co, an Indian company, enters into a contract to acquire new machinery from Beta, an American company. The cost of the machinery is $50,000 and is payable in one year&#x2019;s time. Arson&#x2019;s operating currency is the rupee and the current exchange rate is $1:Rs. 40.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Arson faces the exchange risk associated with the contract. To eliminate this risk, Arson enters into a forward contract to acquire $50,000 in one year&#x2019;s time at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In one year&#x2019;s time, when Arson has to pay $50,000 to Beta for the machinery, it can exercise the forward contract. Arson will therefore, pay Rs. 2,000,000 for the machinery irrespective of whether the exchange rate has moved up or down. This is known as &#x2018;hedging&#x2019;.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Hedge Accounting </span>is a technique that changes the normal basis for recognising gains and losses on associated hedging instruments and hedged items, so that both are recognised in earnings in the same accounting period.</p>
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 8: Hedge Accounting</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p160-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Before understanding the hedge accounting principles and methods that are set out in the standard, it is important for us to understand the concept of <span class="bold">hedged items </span>and <span class="bold">hedging instruments.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Hedged item</span></p>
<p>A hedged item can be a recognised asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment, a forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation. The hedged item can be:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a single item; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a group of items</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>a component of a single item or group of item</p>
<p>In order to be classified as a hedged item for accounting purposes, the item should be <span class="bold">specifically designated </span>as a hedged item for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>Hedge accounting is applicable to recognised assets, recognised liabilities, unrecognised firm commitments, highly probable forecast transactions with a party external to the reporting entity or a net investment in a foreign operation, can be designated as hedged items. Furthermore the following points are also necessary in order to qualify for hedged item:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The hedged item must be reliably measured</li>
<li>If a hedged item is a forecast transaction or a component thereof, that transaction must be highly probable</li>
<li>Hedge accounting can be applied to transactions between entities in the same group only in the individual or separate financial statements of those entities and not in the consolidated financial statements of the group, except for the consolidated financial statements of an investment entity, as defined in IFRS 10, where transactions between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>The foreign currency risk of an intragroup monetary item (e.g. a payable/receivable between two subsidiaries) may qualify as a hedged item in the consolidated financial statements if it results in an exposure to foreign exchange rate gains or losses that are not fully eliminated on consolidation in accordance with IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates..</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Referring to the above example of Arson Co, the payment for machinery of $50,000 is a hedged item, since the exchange rate of 1:40 may change at the time of payment.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Hedging instrument</span></p>
<p>The <span class="bold">hedging instrument </span>is a financial instrument, whose fair value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item. A qualifying instrument must be designated in its entirety as a hedging instrument.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Referring to the above example of Arson Co, the forward contract to buy the foreign currency is the hedging instrument.</p>
</div>
<p>Under IFRS 9 (revised), the following contracts with a party external to the entity may qualify as a hedging instrument:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>All derivative contracts except some written options not designated as offsets to purchased options.</li>
<li>Non-derivative financial asset or liability which are measured at fair value through profit or loss such as cash instruments, except financial liabilities at FVTPL for which the amount of changes in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is presented in OCI</li>
<li>For a hedge of foreign currency risk, the foreign currency risk component of a non-derivative financial asset or a non-derivative financial liability may be designated as a hedging instrument provided that it is not an investment in an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in OCI.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.2 Classification of hedging relationships</span></p>
<p>Hedging relationships fall under three categories:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 9: Classification of hedging relationships</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p161-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Coffee house has fixed the value of its tea inventory by entering into a future contract.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Here, the entity is hedging the risk of changes in the tea inventory&#x2019;s overall fair value. This is an example of <span class="bold">a fair value hedge </span>that often occurs in practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Entity Z, which has a highly probable sale of a commodity in the future at the then prevailing market price, &#x2018;fixes&#x2019; the selling price of the goods by entering into a future contract.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Here, the goods under consideration are hedged item. The future contract which fixes the selling price of the goods is the hedging instrument. By entering into the contract, the entity is hedging the risk of variability in the cash flows to be received on the sale due to changes in the good&#x2019;s market price. This is an example <span class="bold">of a cash flow hedge.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.3 Conditions to be satisfied to qualify for hedge accounting</span></p>
<p>A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, only if <span class="bold">all of the following criteria are met:</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the hedging relationship consists only of eligible hedging instruments and eligible hedged items.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>at the inception of the hedging relationship there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging relationship and the entity&#x2019;s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge. The documentation shall include:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>identification of the hedging instrument,</li>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.4 Hedge effectiveness</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Hedge effectiveness </span>is the extent to which changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedging instrument offset changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedged item.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Hedge ineffectiveness </span>is the extent to which the changes in the fair value or the cash flows of the hedging instrument are greater or less than those on the hedged item</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Conditions to be satisfied</span></p>
<p>In order for a hedging relationship to be effective the following requirements must be satisfied:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>there is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument. This means that the hedging instrument and the hedged item have values that generally move in the opposite direction because of the same risk, which is the hedged risk. For example Brent crude and WTI crude oil can be economically related.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>the effect of credit risk does not dominate the value changes that result from that economic relationship; and</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">UNIC Bank hedges an exposure to commodity price risk using an uncollateralised derivative. If the counterparty to that derivative experiences a severe deterioration in its credit standing, the effect of the changes in the counterparty&#x2019;s credit standing might outweigh the effect of changes in the commodity price on the fair value of the hedging instrument, whereas changes in the value of the hedged item depend largely on the commodity price changes.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>the hedge ratio of the hedging relationship is the same as that resulting from the quantity of the hedged item that the entity actually hedges and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge that quantity of hedged item.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">UBN Global, an investment bank hedges less than 100 per cent of the exposure on an item, such as 85 per cent, it shall designate the hedging relationship using a hedge ratio that is the same as that resulting from 85 per cent of the exposure and the quantity of the hedging instrument that the entity actually uses to hedge those 85 per cent.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Similarly if UBN Global hedges an exposure using a nominal amount of 40 units of a financial instrument, it shall designate the hedging relationship using a hedge ratio that is the same as that resulting from that quantity of 40 units (i.e. the entity must not use a hedge ratio based on a higher quantity of units that it might hold in total or a lower quantity of units) and the quantity of the hedged item that it actually hedges with those 40 units.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Frequency of testing hedge effectiveness</span></p>
<p>An entity shall assess at the inception of the hedging relationship, and on an on-going basis, whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. At a minimum, an entity shall perform the on-going assessment at each reporting date or upon a significant change in the circumstances affecting the hedge effectiveness requirements, whichever comes first. The assessment relates to expectations about hedge effectiveness and is therefore only forward-looking.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Assessing hedge effectiveness</span></p>
<p>IFRS 9 does not specify a method for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. However, an entity shall use a method that captures the relevant characteristics of the hedging relationship including the sources of hedge ineffectiveness. Depending on those factors, the method can be a qualitative or a quantitative assessment</p>
<p>An entity&#x2019;s risk management is the main source of information to perform the assessment of whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements. This means that the management information (or analysis) used for decision-making purposes can be used as a basis for assessing whether a hedging relationship meets the hedge effectiveness requirements</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.5 Classification of hedges</span></p>
<p>Hedges are primarily classified under IFRS 9 into the following three types:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 10: Classification of hedging relationships</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p163-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.6 Accounting treatment of hedges</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Fair value hedges</span></p>
<p>In the case of a fair value hedge, hedging relationship would be accounted for as under:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the hedging instrument should be re-measured at fair value, with the gain or loss to be reported in the statement of profit and loss (or other comprehensive income if the hedging instrument hedges an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income).</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the hedging gain or loss on the hedged item shall adjust the carrying amount of the hedged item (if applicable) and be recognised in profit or loss. However, if the hedged item is an equity instrument for which an entity has elected to present changes in fair value in other comprehensive income, those amounts shall remain in other comprehensive income. When a hedged item is an unrecognised firm commitment (or a component thereof), the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the hedged item is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Cash flow hedges</span></p>
<p>In the case of a cash flow hedge, hedging relationship will be accounted for as:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item (cash flow hedge reserve) is adjusted to the lower of the following (in absolute amounts):</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and</li>
<li>the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the hedged item (i.e. the present value of the cumulative change in the hedged expected future cash flows) from inception of the hedge.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The hedging instrument should be split between the proportion which is effective and the proportion which is ineffective:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The effective proportion should be recognised in <span class="bold">equity (OCI)</span></li>
<li>The ineffective element should be recognised directly in the <span class="bold">statement of profit and loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation</span></p>
<p>Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation shall be accounted for in the same way as the cash flow hedge:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The effective proportion should be recognised in equity (OCI)</li>
<li>The ineffective element should be recognised directly in the statement of profit and loss</li>
</ul>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">6. Describe the nature of the presentation and disclosure requirement relating to financial instruments.</span></p>
<p>Disclosure requirements are dealt with in IFRS 7.</p>
<p>The objective of this IFRS is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the significance of financial instruments for the entity&#x2019;s financial position and performance; and</li>
<li>the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the end of the reporting period, and how the entity manages those risks.</li>
</ul>
<p>An entity shall disclose information that enables users of its financial statements to evaluate the significance of financial instruments for its financial position and performance.</p>
<p>The disclosures relate to the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Statement of financial position</li>
<li>Items of income, expense, gains, and losses</li>
<li>Other income statement related disclosures</li>
<li>Accounting policies</li>
<li>Information about hedge accounting</li>
<li>Nature and extent of exposure to risks arising from financial instruments</li>
<li>Transfer of financial assets</li>
</ul>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>A financial asset of one entity automatically gives rise to a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Proper classification of financial instruments is necessary because misclassification will affect the financial statements.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>False. There exist financial instruments which are compound in nature. They have both debt and equity characteristics. An example is convertible bonds.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>Equity is valued at cost less any transaction costs directly attributable to the equity issue. Changes in fair value of an equity instrument are not recognised in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="hang-NPara">Debt is initially valued at fair value less any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue. If debt is not classified at fair value through profit or loss, then it is subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.</p>
