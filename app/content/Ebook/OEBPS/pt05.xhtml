<p>Acquiring non-current assets under a lease arrangement is a lifeline available to cash-starved companies. Cash-rich companies may also opt for lease arrangements after conducting a cash outflow-benefit analysis, where they may decide to lease because they can invest their money in something that gives a higher return than the interest they need to pay on the lease payments.</p>
<p>Imagine that Cash Co &#x2018;sells&#x2019; a building to Carry Co for 100,000, but in the contract it states that Cash Co will buy the building back within 1 year for $150,000.</p>
<p>You need to look at the &#x2018;substance&#x2019; of the transaction, rather than its strict &#x2018;legal form&#x2019;. That means that instead of looking at the legal document, think about whether it really looks like a sale. Here, it does not look like a sale -why would a company agree to sell something at a low value and then agree to buy it back at a higher value?</p>
<p>In substance, Carry Co has given Cash loan of $100,000 and Cash Co has given Carry Co the building as security. When Cash Co buys back the building, it pays $150,000, which in effect is $100,000 for the building, with $50,000 paid as interest.</p>
<p>Does it seem fair to derecognise the building in Cash Co&#x2019;s accounts? No, it does not, as effectively the asset was just pledged as security just like if a bank requires the deeds of a building as security against a bank loan.</p>
<p>This Study Guide will help you acquire the knowledge required in order to answer examination questions as well as account for leases with ease. It will also teach you how to spot if there is a substance over form issue!</p>
