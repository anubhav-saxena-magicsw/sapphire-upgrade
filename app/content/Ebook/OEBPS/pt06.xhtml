<p>Businesses have long had various non-monetary assets with <span class="bold">no physical substance </span>e.g. import quotas, licences, marketing rights, copyrights and goodwill. Such assets are called &#x2018;intangible&#x2019; assets. </p>
<p>The current era in which we live is also called the <span class="bold">knowledge age. </span>It is characterised by the enlargement of technology and knowledge frontiers. This has added some new kinds of intangible assets e.g. computer software and patents for new inventions.</p>
<p>Businesses now rely on increasing numbers of these assets. They form a <span class="bold">growing proportion </span>of the value of total assets. They are quite different from physical assets and have some <span class="bold">special accounting characteristics and requirements related to valuation, amortisation and impairment</span>. </p>
<p>A modern accountant needs to develop the skills required to be able to account for these types of assets. Understanding this Study Guide will help you deal with this important item in your company&#x2019;s statement of financial position.</p>
