<p>Most companies have assets that are recorded on their statement of financial position at historical cost. These assets are depreciated annually. What happens if an asset is no longer used by the entity, but is not sold? Should the entity still have it on the statement of financial position? If so, at what value? For example, take a specialised computer which was bought for $3,000. It is now two years old and has already been depreciated by $1,500 as its useful life was estimated at four years. Although its net book value in the accounts is $1,500, it has only been used for very basic functions, as the company has bought up to date, faster machines. Does it make sense to still have it valued at $1,500 in the accounts? Probably not, since its usefulness to the company is now extremely limited, as the future economic benefits are likely to be low. We say that the computer has been &#x2018;impaired&#x2019;. The question now arises: at what value should it be stated in the financial statements?</p>
<p>By reading this Study Guide, you will understand the concept of impairment and be able to carry out related calculations and accounting entries. With this, you will be able to deal with impairment of any assets that your company holds. This is extremely important as often non-current assets are among the most important items on the statement of financial position and you need to ensure that they are fairly valued.</p>
