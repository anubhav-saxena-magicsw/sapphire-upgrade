<p>In today&#x2019;s global economy big entities issue share options to their employees as part of the remuneration package. The hidden cost of shares issued to employees is a very important constituent of the employee cost incurred by the entity.</p>
<p>If an entity issues 100 share options each as a bonus to 10 of its employees.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Will this involve just printing a share certificate and issuing it to the employees?</li>
<li>Can the employee, in turn, realise the proceeds by selling the shares in the market?</li>
<li>In the process does the company incur any cost?</li>
</ul>
<p>If this transaction is not accounted for as an expense in the financial books of an entity, it will present an incorrect picture of the financial health of the entity. IFRS 2 deals with the method of recognising and measuring this type of transaction. Until IFRS 2 was issued there was no other IFRS issued to deal with the recognition and measurement of this type of transaction. It is very important to measure these transactions scientifically using generally accepted techniques so that the transaction will reflect a correct picture of the financial health of the entity.</p>
<p>In this Study Guide we will deal with the transactions which involve issue of shares to employees and to others in exchange of services or goods procured by the entity and the method of recognising, measuring and accounting for such transactions.</p>
