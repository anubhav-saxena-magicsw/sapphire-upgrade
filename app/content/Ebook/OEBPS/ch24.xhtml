<p>The global financial crisis that started in 2007 highlighted the lack of transparency about the risks to which investors were exposed from their involvement with &#x2018;off balance sheet vehicles&#x2019; (such as securitization vehicles), including those that they had set up or sponsored. As a result, the G20 leaders, the Financial Stability Board and others asked the Board to review the accounting and disclosure requirements for such &#x2018;off balance sheet vehicles&#x2019;.</p>
<p>In today&#x2019;s global economy, most companies operate as a group, in which one main company controls the operations of many others. Each entity in a group prepares its own financial statements in which the investments in / by other group entities are reported.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Virgin Records, a company in the United Kingdom, is owned by EMI Records to the extent of 75%.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The Statement of financial position of Virgin Records will not reflect this fact separately. The statement of financial position will show simply the aggregate share capital: this will include the share held by EMI Records as well as those of other shareholders in Virgin Records.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, the breakdown of share capital (showing the share held by EMI) will be given in a note to the statement of financial position of Virgin Records, in the following manner:</p>

<p>If the shareholders of the investing company wish to know how their investment is performing i.e., is the other entity making profits or losses, the individual financial statements are of no use. They cannot ascertain the financial viability of the investment made by their company from the individual financial statements they receive from it. They will remain doubtful about whether their money is in safe hands or not.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing with the previous example</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">From the individual financial statements of EMI Records, the shareholders of EMI Records have no means of knowing:</p>

<li>How Virgin Records has deployed its capital among the various assets it owns?</li>
<li>What its liabilities are?</li>
<li>Whether it is earning profits or losses?</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">In short, they cannot ascertain whether the investment in Virgin Records is financially sound or not.</p>
</div>
<p>In a group, one main company controls the operations of many other entities. In such situations, it becomes imperative for the shareholders, directors, employees, suppliers, customers, government departments and other stakeholders to know the financial standing of the group as a whole.</p>
<p>Hence, consolidated financial statements are prepared.</p>
<p><span class="bold">IFRS 10 </span>states that consolidated financial statements have to be prepared where a group of entities are controlled by a parent.</p>
</div>
<p>Consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the group entities, in order to <span class="bold">determine the financial status of the group as if it were one single economic entity.</span></p>
<p>It should be noted that:</p>

<li>merely preparing consolidated financial statements does not establish a single operating unit.</li>

<p>In order to understand the definition and meaning of a subsidiary, it is essential to understand the concept of a group.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Concept of control</span></p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Separate financial statements </span>are those presented by a parent, an investor in an associate or a venturer in a jointly controlled entity, in which the investments are accounted for on the basis of the direct equity interest rather than on the basis of the reported results and net assets of the investees.</p>

<p>Consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of all the group entities, in order to <span class="bold">determine the financial status of the group as if it were one single economic entity.</span></p>
<p>Each entity in a group prepares its own financial statements. However, the individual financial statements are of no use to the shareholders of the investing entity if they wish to know how their investment is doing i.e. is the other entity making profits or losses. They can have legitimate worries about the safety of their money.</p>

<p>However, Van Co made a profit of $1m only because of Dip Co&#x2019;s direction &#x2013; remember Dip Co has control over the financial and operating policies of Van Co as it has controlling interest in Van Co (it holds 100% shares in Van Co). As a result, it can tell Van Co what to do. Now, would it be right to show Dip Co.&#x2019;s shareholders that Dip Co only made a profit of $20,000, when Dip Co was responsible for Van Co&#x2019;s success?</p>
<div class="tip">

<p>The shareholders of Dip Co will want to see what profits the group as a whole (Dip Co and Van Co together) are making and what assets they own as a whole. This will give them a fairer picture of the current position.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The individual statement of financial position&#x2019;s of the two companies do not reflect the reality.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Van Co made a profit of $1m only because of Dip Co which owns 100% of its shares. This fact needs to be brought to the notice of the shareholders of Dip Co.

</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Consolidated financial statements safeguard the interests of the ordinary shareholders of the parent entity. If the subsidiary is making losses, then the parent&#x2019;s share of this loss will be deducted from the profits of the parent entity while preparing the consolidated financial statements. This knowledge helps shareholders to take decisions about retaining or disposing of their investment in the parent entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Superb Co is the 100% owner of Excellent Co. In the year to 31 December 20X6 Superb Co has earned a profit of $2,000m while its subsidiary has made a loss of $3,000m. So the consolidated financial statements will reflect a loss of $1,000m ($2,000m - $3,000m).</p>

Consolidated financial statements provide an overview of the financial status of the group as a whole.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span>Consolidated financial statements help prevent companies from indulging in malpractices and manipulations to avoid taxes, to smooth profits etc. e.g. If consolidation were not compulsory, then heavy inventories in one entity could be transferred as sales to another entity in the group to smooth the profits.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. When subsidiaries should be excluded from consolidated financial statements.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Exclusions from consolidation</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">IFRS 10 states that consolidated financial statements shall include the accounts of all the subsidiaries of the parent. The standard </span>has been <span class="bold">very strict about exclusions </span>from consolidated financial statements because <span class="bold">otherwise companies would manipulate their results.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A group with a loss-making subsidiary would like to exclude its accounts from its consolidated financial statements. Inclusion of this subsidiary would mean that the profitability of the group as a whole would show a decline.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The parent would like to conceal this information if (say) it wished to issue new equity. So if there was no compulsion to consolidate the financial statements of all subsidiaries, then the parent would manipulate its results by not including the accounts of the loss making subsidiary.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Directors may not wish to consolidate a subsidiary for a number of reasons, the primary concern being the desire to show good financial results.</span></p>
<p>This can be achieved by not including subsidiaries which:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>are incurring losses (as in the example above)</li>
<li>have a high inventory level</li>
<li>do not have a growth rate on a par with the average for the group</li>
<li>have high borrowings</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Subsidiaries which cannot be excluded from consolidation</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">IFRS 10 </span>states that the consolidated accounts should include all of the parent&#x2019;s subsidiaries, both domestic and foreign there are no specific exemptions for following subsidiaries:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>A subsidiary whose <span class="bold">business activities are dissimilar </span>from those of the other entities within the group.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Subsidiaries of <span class="bold">venture capital organisations, mutual funds, unit trust or any other similar entity.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span><span class="bold">Subsidiaries held for sale </span>i.e. investments by a parent in an entity only for the purpose of selling it.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Amendment to IFRS 10 due to investment entities</span></p>
<p>Investment entities will be exempted from consolidating controlled investees under amendments introduced to IFRS 10, &#x2018;Consolidated financial statements&#x2019;. IASB issued amendments to IFRS 10, IFRS 12, &#x2018;Disclosure of interests in other entities&#x2019; and IAS 27, &#x2018;Separate financial statements&#x2019;, in October 2012 clarifying that investment entity that qualify will be able to fair value controlled investments, rather than having to consolidate them</p>
<p>An investment entity is an entity that:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>obtains funds from one or more investors for the purpose of providing those investor(s) with investment management services (investment services condition)</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>commits to its investor(s) that its business purpose is to invest funds solely for returns from capital appreciation, investment income, or both (business purpose condition)</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>measures and evaluates the performance of substantially all of its investments on a fair value basis (fair value condition).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Typical characteristics of an investment entity:</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>it has more than one investment</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>it has more than one investor</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>it has investors that are not related parties of the entity</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(iv) </span>it has ownership interests in the form of equity or similar interests.</p>
<p>According to the amendment <span class="bold">investment entities are no longer required to consolidate investments </span>that are controlling interest in in other entities as required by IFRS 3. An investment entity is required to measure an investment in a subsidiary at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 Financial Instrument.</p>

<p>First of all, scrutinise the individual accounts of the parent and all its subsidiaries.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Cancel all intra-group items </span>e.g. items that appear as an asset in one entity (e.g. trade receivable) and a liability in the other (e.g. trade payable) which belong to group companies.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Add together all un-cancelled assets and liabilities </span>of the parent and the subsidiary, line by line and reflect in the consolidated statement of financial position.</li>

<p>This represents <span class="bold">all the assets and liabilities of the group as a whole,</span> whether belonging to the parent or the subsidiary.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Consideration (cost of acquisition)</span></p>
<p>The consideration transferred in a business combination is to be measured at fair value. Consideration can be paid in any form such as cash, other assets, ordinary or preference equity instruments, options, warrants etc. It should be calculated as the sum of the fair values (as at acquisition date) of the assets transferred by the acquirer, the liabilities incurred by the acquirer to former owners of the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the acquirer.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Contingent consideration</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Contingent consideration </span>is the consideration that an acquirer commits to the acquiree in cash or additional equity interests or other assets after the acquisition date on the fulfilment of a certain specified event or condition in the future.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Deferred consideration</span></p>
<p>Any consideration which is not payable immediately but is payable in the future and which is not contingent is called a deferred consideration.</p>
<p>Such consideration should be valued at present value of the amount payable. For this, amount payable in future should be multiplied by the present value factor (present value factor is calculated using the cost of capital to the parent).</p>

<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>

</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Non-Controlling Interest (NCI)</span></p>
<p>IAS 27 requires the consolidated financial statements of the group to include the accounts of all its subsidiaries (whether wholly or partly owned) under the full consolidation method i.e. 100% consolidation.</p>
<p>When a subsidiary is not wholly owned, (i.e. owned 100% by the parent), a part of the net assets belong to the minority shareholders. This is called the non-controlling interest (NCI) (previously known as minority interest). IFRS 3 allows an accounting policy choice, available on a transaction by transaction basis, to measure NCI either at:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>fair value (sometimes called the full goodwill method); or</li>
<li>the NCI&#x2019;s proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree (option is available on a transaction by transaction basis).</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Management must <span class="bold">elect,</span> for each acquisition, the option to measure the NCI.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>If NCI is measured at fair value, it can be determined by referring to the market price of shares held by non-controlling shareholders just before the acquisition by the parent.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p>IFRS 3 gives us two options in measurement of non-controlling interest</p>
<p><span class="bold">Option 1: measuring non-controlling interest at fair value </span>we do not add pre-acquisition reserves to the non-controlling interest because that is already taken care of by the fair value of NCI.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Option 2: measuring non-controlling interest by calculating the share of the value of net assets acquired in accordance with revised IFRS 3 - </span>we add the pre-acquisition reserves to the NCI<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">NCI to be shown in the statement of financial position is calculated as the value of NCI considered for calculation of goodwill + post-acquisition profit.</span></p>

<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Definition</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Goodwill is an asset representing the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a <span class="bold">business combination </span>that are not individually identified and separately recognised.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement and recognition of goodwill in consolidated financial statements:</span></p>
<p>Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the total of (the purchase consideration + value of non-controlling interest) over the acquisition date net assets. Therefore, <span class="bold">goodwill is a residual value.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Mac Peter&#x2019;s </span>is a very successful restaurant. However, Peter (the owner) is now old and wants to sell his restaurant.</p>
<p class="boxpara">He knows that the value that the new owner of his business will get is more than JUST the price of the chairs, tables, premises, inventory etc.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The new owner will get a successful business and will not have to worry about getting any customers.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Peter will definitely <span class="bold">demand and obtain a price for the name that he has built up.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">If the value of the net identifiable assets of <span class="bold">Mac Peter&#x2019;s </span>is $40,000 but Peter demands and obtains $50,000 for his business, then this additional price or premium of $10,000 ($50,000 &#x2013; $40,000) which Peter gets is <span class="bold">positive goodwill.</span></p>
</div>
<p>As stated above, since there are two ways of calculating NCI, goodwill can be calculated using two methods:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Full goodwill method:</span> based on fair value of NCI</li>
<li><span class="bold">Partial goodwill method:</span> based on share of NCI in the value of net assets of the company acquired. In this case goodwill shows only the acquirer&#x2019;s share (this is because in connection with the non-controlling interest, the same amount is repeated in both, value of NCI and net assets of subsidiary, and therefore does not affect goodwill)</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">What should an entity do - should it calculate &#x201C;full goodwill&#x201D; or partial goodwill?</span></p>
<p>This only makes a difference in an acquisition where less than 100% of the acquired business is purchased.</p>
<p>Recognising &#x201C;full goodwill&#x201D; will increase reported net assets in the consolidated statement of financial position. The amount recognised for goodwill will be higher, and therefore, any future impairment of goodwill will be higher. Measuring NCI at fair value may prove difficult in practice where, for example, there are no market prices to rely on.</p>
<p>On the plus side, a company planning a cash buy-out of the NCI may wish to record NCI at fair value and recognise full goodwill in a business combination as there will be a lower difference between the consideration paid for the NCI and its recorded value resulting in a lower decrease in equity following the purchase of the NCI.</p>
<p>The US standard on business combinations requires goodwill to be calculated on a &#x201C;full&#x201D; basis.</p>

<p>Consolidated financial statements are prepared by combining the financial statements of the parent and its subsidiaries line by line, by<span class="bold"> adding together like items </span>of assets, liabilities, equity, income and expenses.</p>
<p><span class="bold">IFRS 10 </span>requires that <span class="bold">all intra-group balances and transactions, including income and expenses, are eliminated in full. </span>This is because:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span><span class="bold">If such transactions are not eliminated,</span> the <span class="bold">consolidated financial statements </span>will show an <span class="bold">inflated </span>and hence <span class="bold">misleading picture </span>of the financial status of the group.</p>

<p><span class="bold">IFRS 3 </span>requires that all business combinations shall be accounted for by applying the <span class="bold">acquisition method</span></p>
<p>which states that <span class="bold">fair values </span>are to be used while <span class="bold">measuring the cost of the business combination (purchase consideration).</span></p>
<p>The standard also requires that the acquirer should measure the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition-date fair values and also permits measurement of non-controlling interest at the acquisition-date fair value.</p>
<p>This means that in the business combinations, fair value will be used for the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>cost of investment (purchase consideration)</li>
<li>identifiable assets and liabilities</li>
<li>non-controlling interest and</li>
<li>acquirer&#x2019;s previously held investment in acquiree, in the case of step acquisition</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">The acquirer shall measure the cost of a business combination as the aggregate of the fair values,</span> at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the acquirer, in exchange for control of the entity.</p>
<p>Thus, applying the <span class="bold">acquisition method </span>to business combinations means that <span class="bold">the cost is viewed from the acquirer&#x2019;s perspective </span>and valued at fair value.</p>
<p><span class="bold">What is fair value?</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Features of this definition</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Exit price: </span>according to the new definition, fair value is defined as the exit price; the wordings &#x201C;price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability&#x201D; specifies this.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Current price: </span>fair value is the current price; the term &#x201C;at measurement date&#x201D; specifies this.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Normal transaction: </span>the fair value is the value based on a normal transaction and not on forced or distress sale; the term &#x201C;orderly transaction&#x201D; specifies it.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 20 May 2011, East India Bank purchased 10,000 shares of General Electric (GE) listed on NYSE at $19.75 per share. These shares form part of the trading portfolio of East India Bank. On 31 December 2011, the bid price of a GE share is $22 and the ask price is $22.05.</p>
<p class="boxpara">What is the fair value of these shares in the statement of financial position as at 31 December 2011?</p>
<p class="boxpara">The price within the bid-ask spread that is most representative of fair value in the circumstances shall be used to measure fair value.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The uses of bid prices for asset positions and ask prices for liability positions is permitted, but not required.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The fair value of a General Electric share could either be the bid price for East India Bank, i.e. $22, or the most representative price between 22.00 and 22.05. If we use the rate of $22.00, the fair value of the shares will be: 10,000 x $22 = $220,000</p>
</div>
<p>The entity&#x2019;s specific use or plans are not considered to determine the fair value. Rather, various characteristics are considered by market participants. Such characteristics may include the condition and location of an asset or restrictions on an asset&#x2019;s sale or use.</p>
<p>For non-financial assets like property, plant and equipment, the fair value is based on the perspective of market participants of its highest and best use.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Which markets?</span></p>
<p>A fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>in the <span class="bold">principal market </span>for the asset or liability; or</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>in the absence of a principal market, in the most <span class="bold">advantageous market </span>for the asset or liability.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Principal market </span>is the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset or liability.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Most advantageous market </span>is the market that maximises the amount that would be received to sell the asset or minimises the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability after taking into account transaction costs and transport costs.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Highest and best use</span></p>
<p>The highest and best use refers to the use of a non-financial asset by market participants that would maximise the value of the asset. The highest and best use takes into account factors like:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>Physically possible: </span>this considers physical characteristics (location and size of property).</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2. </span>Legally permissible: </span>this considers legal restrictions on the use of asset while pricing the asset.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">3. </span>Financially feasible: </span>this considers whether the use of the asset generates the investment return that market participants would require from an investment in that asset that is put to a particular use<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Fair value hierarchy</span></p>
<p>To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, IFRS 13 establishes a fair value hierarchy that categorises into three levels the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (also referred to as Level 1 inputs) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (also referred to as Level 3 inputs).</p>
<p>The three broad categories include the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Level 1: </span>These include observable quoted prices, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the measurement date</li>
<li><span class="bold">Level 2: </span>Sometimes when quoted prices are not available for an identical asset or liability, then in such case fair value is based on observable market data. These can include quoted price for similar asset or liability, interest rate yield curves, etc.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Level 3: </span>These are unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities. Unobservable inputs are those for which market data is not available. Therefore they are developed using the best available assumptions that would be used for the purposes of pricing the asset or liability. They are only used when inputs are not available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The entity ideally should maximise the use of relevant observable inputs and should restrict the use of unobservable ones to a minimum.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Fair values are used when preparing consolidated financial statements because:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The acquirer <span class="bold">will have absolutely no interest </span>in the <span class="bold">historical costs </span>of the assets and liabilities of the entity it has taken over.</li>
<li>The acquirer will be interested in the <span class="bold">rational </span>and <span class="bold">unbiased estimate </span>of the potential <span class="bold">market price </span>of goods, services, assets, or liabilities of the entity as on the date of purchase of the subsidiary.</li>

<p>As stated earlier, IFRS 3 requires that the above items such as purchase consideration should be calculated at fair value. The impact of such calculation is discussed below:</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.1 The effects of fair value adjustments to assets</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Depreciating non-current assets</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">a) Increase in fair value</span></p>
<p>If at the date of acquisition, the asset&#x2019;s value has increased, then the consolidated financial statements must reflect the increase and show the asset at its fair value. From this date on, the asset will always be consolidated at its fair value (as at the date of acquisition, if it has not been revalued subsequently) and depreciation will be based on the fair value, not book value. Remember these adjustments will happen only on consolidation &#x2013; the net book values in the subsidiary&#x2019;s books will stay the same.</p>
<p>The following journal entry will be made to record the increase in the fair value of a non-current asset</p>
<p><img src="images/356-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p>The total difference between fair value and carrying value (also called fair value adjustment) will be considered while calculating goodwill.</p>
<p>NCI&#x2019;s share of these fair value adjustments to individual assets /liabilities will be relevant only for calculation of NCI value using proportionate net assets method. If fair value method is used for NCI valuation, this need not be separately considered.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.2 Account for the effects of fair value adjustments to monetary liabilities</span></p>
<p>A <span class="bold">monetary liability </span>is the promise to <span class="bold">pay a specified amount of money,</span> the sum of which is <span class="bold">unaffected by inflation or deflation.</span> There is normally an increase or decrease in a monetary liability if foreign exchange is involved in the transaction.</p>
<p>If as a result of fair value adjustments there is <span class="bold">an increase </span>in the carrying amount of any monetary liability, then:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Journal entry for increase in carrying amount:</span></p>

<p>If as a result of fair value adjustments there is <span class="bold">a decrease </span>in the carrying amount of any monetary liability, then:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Journal entry for decrease in carrying amount:</span></p>
<p><img src="images/358-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.3 Effect of fair value adjustments (to assets and liabilities) on consolidated goodwill</span></p>
<p>IFRS 3 requires that the fair values of net assets be considered when calculating goodwill. As goodwill is the difference between the consideration paid for assets / liabilities and the fair value of those assets / liabilities, it follows that, the higher the (fair) value of assets, the smaller the &#x2018;difference&#x2019; and hence the lower the goodwill.</p>
<p>Goodwill calculations based on fair values are more <span class="bold">realistic </span>as they take into account the <span class="bold">changing prices.</span></p>
<p>The four possible outcomes of fair value adjustments are:</p>

<p>In this method, goodwill value is higher than the partial method by $340, i.e. the difference between the fair value of NCI and its share of net assets (2500 - 2160). The amount of NCI is also higher by this amount.</p>
