<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Definition of associate</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">associate </span>is an entity over which the investor has significant influence.<span class="bold"></span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Significant influence is </span>the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.</p>
</div>
<p>A company exercises significant influence over another when:</p>
<p>It <span class="bold">cannot dictate terms yet </span>the other entity <span class="bold">has to consider </span>what it says.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Formation of associate companies</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p370-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Direct holdings</span></p>
<p>An entity becomes an associate of another entity, when it directly holds<span class="bold"> 20% or more but less than 50% of the voting rights </span>in another entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Moonbeam Inc owns 30% of the issued ordinary shares of Starlight Co. Therefore Starlight is an associate of Moonbeam.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Indirect holdings</span></p>
<p>An entity becomes an associate of another entity when indirectly through subsidiaries it holds more than 20% but less than 50% of the voting rights in another entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sunshine Inc owns 60% of Moonbeam Inc&#x2019;s shares. Moonbeam Inc owns 30% of Starlight Co&#x2019;s shares.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Here, although Sunshine does not hold any share in Starlight, it controls Moonbeam which can exercise significant influence over Starlight (as it holds more than 20% and less than 50% shares in Starlight).</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore indirectly through Moonbeam, Sunshine can influence the operational or financial decisions of Starlight and as a result, it is an associate of Sunshine.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Holdings due to the existence and effect of potential voting rights</span></p>
<p>It has been already discussed that an entity may own share warrants, share call options or debt or equity instruments that can be converted into ordinary shares of another entity.<span class="bold"></span></p>
<p>It could also have similar instruments which have the potential, if the right is exercised or converted, to increase the share of its voting power or reduce the share of some other&#x2019;s voting power over the financial and operating policies of the other entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Potential voting rights </span>are rights which when exercised or converted either increase or decrease a party&#x2019;s voting rights in another party.</p>
</div>
<p>It is essential to ascertain whether the existence and conversion of potential voting rights lead to a change in the shareholding pattern, resulting in the formation of an associate. In ascertaining whether potential voting rights lead to formation of an associate, potential voting rights of all the company&#x2019;s shareholders must be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The entity has to examine all facts and circumstances (including terms of any agreements, or contractual arrangements) that affect potential voting rights, except the intention of management and the financial ability to exercise the conversion.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Significant Influence can exist even if the shareholding is less than 20%.</span></p>
<p>Even though the shareholding is below 20%, significant influence can still exist, but only if the entity can clearly demonstrate that it has significant influence over the other entity.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">5. Holdings of associate companies compared with holdings of other companies in associate companies</span></p>
<p>A substantial or majority ownership by another investor does not necessarily preclude an investor from having significant influence.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Good Co holds 70% of Excellent Co and Fair Co hold 20% of Excellent Co.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Then, Good Co is the parent of Excellent Co (as it holds <span class="bold">more than 50%); </span>BUT this does not stop Excellent Company from being an associate of Fair Company (as Fair Co <span class="bold">directly </span>holds <span class="bold">more than 20% and less than 50% of </span>Excellent Co). It also means that while Good can control what Excellent does, Good should also take note of Fair&#x2019;s views, as Fair still exerts significant influence.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Equity accounting</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">IAS 28 </span>states that <span class="bold">investments in associates and joint ventures </span>should be accounted for using the <span class="bold">equity method. </span>The equity method of accounting is used because the investment in an associate or joint venture is actually the non-controlling interest. (The provisions relating to joint ventures are discussed later in this Study Guide.)</p>
<p>Consolidation is not suitable because the investor does <span class="bold">not have control </span>over the assets and liabilities of the associate company or the joint venture. Hence consolidation would depict a misleading picture of the assets and liabilities of the group.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Equity Method is a method of accounting whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the investor's share of the investee's net assets. The investor's profit or loss includes its share of the investee's profit or loss and the investor's other comprehensive income includes its share of the investee's other comprehensive income.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Principles of equity accounting</span></p>
<p>Under this method:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. In the consolidated statement of financial position</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">On date of acquisition:</span> The <span class="bold">investment </span>in the associate company is <span class="bold">stated at cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">After acquisition:</span> Every year, the investment in associate company will be reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position after making the following adjustments:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">If the associate makes a profit: </span>G<span class="bold">roup share </span>of <span class="bold">profit </span>will be <span class="bold">added </span>to <span class="bold">investment</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">If the associate makes a loss: </span>G<span class="bold">roup share </span>of <span class="bold">loss </span>will be <span class="bold">deducted </span>from<span class="bold"> investment</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">The procedures used </span>for determining the profit/loss under the <span class="bold">equity method </span>are similar to those used for determining profit/loss under the <span class="bold">full consolidation method.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. In the consolidated statement of profit or loss</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">group&#x2019;s share </span>in the<span class="bold"> pre-acquisition profits </span>of the associate company:</li>
</ul>
<p>On the date of acquisition, the pre-acquisition profits have to be revised, to incorporate all fair value adjustments. The group&#x2019;s share in this revised profit will be <span class="bold">deducted from consideration </span>in arriving at <span class="bold">goodwill. </span>(The goodwill calculation is explained later in this section).</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">group&#x2019;s share </span>in the<span class="bold"> post-acquisition profits </span>of the associate company is included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Procedures to be followed for the equity method of accounting:</span></p>

</div>
<p>All adjustments made for goodwill impairment and fair value changes in accounting for subsidiaries are also made in accounting for associates. If the group&#x2019;s share in the losses of the associate exceeds its investment in the associate, then the investor has to stop accounting for further losses. The cost of investment will be recorded at nil in the consolidated financial statements. Any further losses will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements only if the investor has directly made some payment or guarantees on behalf of the associate.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Joint arrangement </span>is an arrangement of which two or more parties have joint control.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Joint Control </span>is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the <span class="bold">relevant activities </span>require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">To identify the existence of joint arrangement according to IFRS 11:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>First we need to analyse whether collective control exists;</li>
<li>and then we need to analyse the contractual arrangement to ascertain whether the parties to the contract possess joint control over the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note: control, group, holding company and subsidiary bear the same meaning as in IFRS 10.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Collective control </span>has not been defined in IFRS 11; however, it can be interpreted as the ability of all the parties to the contract to collectively exercise control. Thus, the standard requires that at the first stage, it should be assessed whether all the parties collectively exercise control over the arrangement.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Joint control </span>exists only when decisions related to relevant activities (activities that significantly affect the returns of the joint arrangement) require unanimous consent of the parties sharing the control. Thus, in the case of joint control, a single party or parties holding the majority of stake cannot take decisions without the consent of other party/parties to the contract.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">characteristics of a joint arrangement </span>are:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span></span>The <span class="bold">existence of a contract </span>between two or more parties</p>
<p>This is the main feature which distinguishes a joint arrangement from an investment in an associate. There is no contractual agreement when there is an investment in an associate while a contract always exists when there is a joint arrangement.</p>
<p>A contract is usually in writing and contains:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the activity, duration and reporting obligations of the joint venture</li>
<li>the appointment of the board of directors or equivalent governing body of the joint venture </li>
<li>the voting rights of the venturers (the parties to the contract)</li>
<li>the capital contributions by the venturers; and</li>
<li>the sharing by the venturers of the output, income, expenses or results of the joint venture.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2. </span></span>As a result of this contract the parties exercise joint control over the resulting arrangement.</p>
<p>The main characteristic of joint control is the requirement of <span class="bold">unanimous consent </span>of the parties sharing control <span class="bold">before any financial or operating decision can be taken.</span> This means that all the parties to the contract are on the same footing and no party is superior to the other. The contract may decide that one party is the operator of the joint arrangement. This does not mean that the operator has more control than the others. The operator has to abide by the financial and operating decisions taken by all the parties.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Entities A, B, C and D each hold a 25% interest in Alpha Inc. Decisions in Alpha Inc need to be approved by a 75% vote of the parties.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alpha Inc is not jointly controlled. For there to be joint control, the voting arrangements would have to require unanimous agreement between those sharing the joint control of Alpha Inc. The voting arrangements of Alpha Inc allow agreement of any combination of three of the four investors to make decisions. The standard refers to this as collective control. Each investor will account for its interest in Alpha Inc as an associate since each entity is presumed to have significant influence, but not joint control.</p>
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements identifies two different types of joint arrangements:</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p375-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Joint Operation</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Joint operation </span>is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the assets, and obligations for the liabilities, relating to the arrangement</p>
</div>
<p>In this type of joint arrangement, the venturers referred to as joint operators have rights over the assets and obligations for the liabilities relating to the joint arrangement.</p>
<p>Each joint operator may:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>use its own property, plant and equipment and carry its own inventories</li>
<li>incur its own expenses and liabilities </li>
<li>raise its own finance, which represents its own obligations</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, each joint operator may have joint control and often the joint ownership of one or more assets:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>contributed to or acquired for the purpose of the joint arrangement; and </li>
<li>dedicated to the purposes of the arrangement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each joint operator may take a share of the output from the assets and each bears an agreed share of the expenses incurred.</p>
<p>The joint venture agreement usually states how the revenue from the sale of the joint product and any expenses incurred in common is to be shared among the joint operators.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Airship and Chelot enter into a contract to combine their operations, resources and expertise to manufacture and sell an aircraft. According to the contract:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Different parts of the manufacturing process are carried out by each of the venturers</li>
<li>Each venturer bears its own costs of manufacture</li>
<li>The common expenses and revenue from the sale of the aircraft to be split according to the proportion of direct expenses incurred</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">A joint arrangement of this type is a joint operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the case of oil, gas and mineral extraction industry, a number of oil production companies jointly control and operate an oil pipeline.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Each venturer uses the pipeline to transport its own product in return for which it bears an agreed proportion of the expenses of operating the pipeline.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Accounting treatment</span></p>
<p>While accounting for its share in the joint operation, a joint operator recognises in its books:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>its assets, including its share of any assets held jointly;</li>
<li>its liabilities, including its share of any liabilities incurred jointly;</li>
<li>its revenue from the sale of its share of the output of the joint operation;</li>
<li>its share of the revenue from the sale of the output by the joint operation; and</li>
<li>its expenses, including its share of any expenses incurred jointly.</li>
</ul>
<p>A joint operator accounts for the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses relating to its involvement in a joint operation in accordance with the relevant IFRSs.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.5 Joint Venture</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Joint venture </span>is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement.</p>
</div>
<p>In this type of joint arrangements, the <span class="bold">venturers establish a corporation, partnership or other separate entity in order to undertake an economic activity.</span></p>
<p>The entity operates in the same way as other entities. The only distinguishing feature is that there exists a contract between the venturers in order to establish joint control over the financial and operating decisions relating to the activity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Milky Group, a real estate fund, has obtained an investment in entity T in a relatively undeveloped country. The in-country requirements for foreign ownership of T do not permit a local entity to be controlled by a foreign entity. Milky Group therefore enters into a shareholders&#x2019; agreement with a local investor B, whereby documents are drawn up showing that whilst voting control of the company is with investor B, all decisions will need to be ratified by Milky Group before B can proceed. The agreement also confirms that the assets of the arrangement are owned by the company. Neither party will be able to sell, pledge, transfer or otherwise mortgage the assets.</p>
<p class="boxpara">What kind of arrangement is this and how will it be accounted for in the consolidated accounts of Milky Group?</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Under IFRS 11, Milky Group needs to consider the type of joint arrangement. On the basis of the contractual rights and obligations, the arrangement would be considered a joint venture, as A has a right to the net assets of T. IFRS 11 requires all joint ventures to use the equity accounting method outlined in IAS 28.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Accounting treatment</span></p>
<p>Joint venture has to maintain its own accounting records and prepare and present financial statements in the same way as other entities according to the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards. Each venturer usually contributes cash or other resources to the joint venture. These contributions are included in the accounting records of the venturer and recognised in its financial statements as an <span class="bold">investment in the joint venture.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the case study given above any cash or other resources given to the jointly controlled entity United Spiral Pipe LLC, by the venturers United States Steel Corp, Posco and Seah Steel Corp will be recorded in their individual financial statements as &#x2018;Investment in United Spiral Pipe LLC&#x2019;.</p>
</div>
<p>A venturer should recognise its interest in a joint venture using the equity method.</p>

<p class="boxpara">IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities gives guidance on disclosures requirements pertaining to subsidiaries, joint arrangements, associates and unconsolidated structured entities. This Standard was issued in May 2011 by the IASB.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The definition of subsidiary, associates and joint arrangements have already been discussed throughout in Section D. Let us briefly understand the meaning of unconsolidated structured entity.</p>
<p class="boxpara">First of all the disclosure requirement of interest in unconsolidated structure entities was a response of IASB to the global financial crisis which started in 2007 due to lack of transparency of the risk, the reporting entity is being exposed and also due to its involvement in structured entity.<br/>
<span class="bold">Definition: </span>A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when any voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directed by means of contractual arrangements.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Examples of such structured entity include securitisation vehicles, asset backed financing or some investment funds.</p>
<p class="boxpara">IFRS 12 gives disclosure requirements for such structured entities which broadly include:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>quantitative and qualitative interest of nature of interest nature of interest</li>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answer to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The main feature which distinguishes a joint venture from an investment in an associate is the existence or absence of a contract. There is no contractual agreement when there is an investment in an associate while a contract always exists when there is a joint venture.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The statement is false; a joint arrangement in the form of a separate vehicle may be either a joint venture or a joint operation depending upon the nature of the arrangement.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Generally, an entity is classified as an associate of another entity only when the other entity holds 20% or more of the shares of another entity. However, even if the shareholding is less than 20%, the entity can still be classified as an associate of another entity if and only if it can be demonstrated that it has significant influence over the entity. Hence, Dimkac Inc can be classified as an associate if significant influence can be demonstrated.</p>
