<p>There is no doubt that financial statements provide very useful information. However, if the data in the statements are supported by the disclosure of important financial ratios, the usefulness of the statements greatly increases. One such important ratio is Earnings per Share (EPS).</p>
<p>The statement of profit or loss discloses the absolute amount of profit, whereas the EPS presents a relative profit figure. EPS is simply calculated by dividing earnings by the number of shares. EPS highlights the efficiency in the use of resources. If resources (cash received by issuing shares) have increased by 50%, the earnings should also, ideally, increase by around 50%. This will maintain the EPS. However if the earnings increase by only 25%, the EPS will be reduced, highlighting the fact that the additional resources were not used efficiently.</p>
<p>Some of the important factors that determine the share prices on stock markets are the EPS for the company and the Price/Earnings ratio (P/E ratio) prevailing for the industry in which the company operates.</p>
<p>Certain convertible instruments can be modified into ordinary shares. Mostly these conversions will not give cash to the company. Since resources are not increased, earnings will not increase. However, the number of shares will increase. This reduces the earnings per share. This is called a diluted EPS.</p>
<p>In order to progress, you will need to understand what EPS and diluted EPS represent. You will also have to calculate these figures as all listed companies need to disclose it. This Study Guide will ensure you can do that in the future!</p>
