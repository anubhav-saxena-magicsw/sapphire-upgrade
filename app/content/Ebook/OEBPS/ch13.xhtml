<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Recognise the scope of international accounting standards for agriculture.</span></p>
<p>IAS 41 applies to accounting of the following agricultural activities:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Biological assets excluding biological assets</li>
<li>Agricultural produce at the point of harvest</li>
<li>Government grants</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">1.1 </span>First of all, we need to know <span class="bold">what biological assets are:</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">biological asset </span>is a living animal or plant.</p>
</div>
<p>All living plants and animals are considered biological assets (e.g. cattle, trees, vines, sheep and other plants).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Jim&#x2019;s dairy farm has 200 cattle. Due to an outbreak of disease, 40 cattle die. Now, only 160 cattle will be considered biological assets and 40 cattle will not be considered biological assets, as they are dead.</p>
</div>
<p>Also, biological assets that are not used in <span class="bold">agricultural activity </span>will remain outside the scope of the standard.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Suppose the Victoria Zoo has 80 animals. The animals in the zoo do not have an active breeding activity and are not reared for the purpose of sale of their products. So, they will remain outside the scope of the standard and are not biological assets.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">1.2 This </span>standard applies to <span class="bold">agricultural produce only at the point of harvest.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Agricultural produce </span>is the harvested product of the entity&#x2019;s biological assets.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Harvest </span>is the detachment of produce from a biological asset or the cessation of a biological asset&#x2019;s life processes.</p>
</div>
<p>It is important to note that the standard only applies to agricultural produce <span class="bold">at the point of harvest.</span> This means only that agricultural produce will be considered, which occurs as a result of harvesting.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">High Levels Co has a big orchard in the outskirts of Berlin. The apples harvested from there will be considered agricultural produce, as they are the result of the agricultural activity at the point of harvest.</p>
</div>
<p>However, <span class="bold">the standard does not deal with the processing of agricultural produce after harvest.</span> Any product produced as a result of the processing of the agricultural produce will not be considered agricultural produce. It makes no difference, even if the processing is an extension of the agricultural activity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A sheep is reared to give us wool. The wool is further processed to make yarn and carpet. Here:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The sheep is a biological asset</li>
<li>The wool is the agricultural produce</li>
<li>The yarn and carpet would not be considered agricultural produce, as they are the result of processing after harvest</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The table given below will explain the differences between biological assets, agricultural produce and products that are the result of processing after harvest.</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p225-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Remember that the standard applies to agricultural activity at the point of harvest and does not deal with the processing of agricultural activity after the point of harvest.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Government grants </span>related to biological assets are also included in the accounting standards.</p>
<p>IAS 20 requires that government grants should not be recognised until:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>There is an assurance that the grant will be received and;</li>
<li>The entity will comply with the conditions attached to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard does not apply to:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Land related to agricultural activity.</li>
<li>Intangible assets related to agricultural activity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Biological assets that are physically attached to the land should be measured separately from the land.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rahim owns big farms on which tomatoes are grown. The provisions of this standard do not apply to Rahim&#x2019;s farm. The tomato plants are biological assets and will be covered by this standard and will be measured separately from the farm.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The standard does not apply to any intangible asset related to agricultural activity. Intangible assets are identifiable non-monetary assets, which are not physical substances and cannot be touched.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Kerry Dairy Farms has 80 cattle in its farm. Kerry Dairy Farms has also earned goodwill in the market, as the company has been in the business for the last 20 years and has maintained the quality of its dairy products such as cheese and butter. However, the standard will not apply to intangible assets such as goodwill.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. The recognition and measurement criteria including the treatment of gains and losses, and the inability to measure fair value reliably.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Recognition</span></p>
<p>An asset can be recognised as a biological asset or agricultural produce when and only when <span class="bold">ALL </span>of the following three conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">asset is controlled due to some past events.</span> These events can be legal ownership of livestock, the branding (marking) of an animal or its birth.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Probable future benefits related to the asset flow to the entity.</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">The fair value or the cost of the asset can be measured with accuracy.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">XYZ Ranch Ltd owns a sheep farm and has a flock of 200 sheep. The sheep will be recognised as biological assets as soon as the sheep are purchased by the company or the company obtains legal ownership of the livestock. Furthermore, when the entity is in a position to gain monetary benefits from the sale of wool, then wool will be recognised as agricultural produce.</p>
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Recognition of biological asset and agricultural produce</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p226-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Measurement</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>A biological asset shall be measured on initial recognition and at the end of each reporting period at its fair value less costs to sell, except where the fair value cannot be measured reliably.</li>
<li>Agricultural produce harvested from an entity&#x2019;s biological assets shall be measured at its fair value less costs to sell at the point of harvest.</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard requires an entity to use a fair value approach, when measuring its biological assets and agricultural produce. To understand this, we need to know how to <span class="bold">determine the fair value.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Fair value </span>is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at a measurement date.</p>
</div>
<p>Fair value is the amount at which an asset can be exchanged or a liability settled in the market. It should be noted that fair value depends upon the asset&#x2019;s present location and condition.</p>
<p>As a result, the fair value considered should take into account related cost to sell, if any. For example, the fair value of cattle at a farm is the price for the cattle in the relevant market less the transport and other costs of getting the cattle to that market.</p>
<p>The standard states that the determination of fair value for a biological asset or agricultural produce can be done by grouping biological assets or agricultural produce according to significant attributes; for example, by age or by quality.</p>
<p>An entity selects the attributes corresponding to the attributes used in the market, as a basis for pricing.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">JKL dairy farms own cattle and calves. The calves are of different age groups. So, to determine their fair value, the first step would be to group the calves according to their age groups i.e. 2 years, 3 years and so on.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Active market</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>If there is an active market for a biological asset or agricultural produce in its present location and condition, <span class="bold">the price quoted in the market will be the fair value of the asset or the produce.</span></li>
<li>If an entity has access to different active markets,<span class="bold"> the entity uses the most relevant market.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An active market is a market where all the following conditions exist:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The items traded within the market are homogeneous.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Willing buyers and sellers can normally be found at any time.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Prices are known to the public.</p>
</div>
<p>An <span class="bold">active market </span>is a market which is uniform and where there are willing buyers and sellers for the produce.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">DEF Grapes Ltd sells agricultural produce, i.e. grapes, in three different markets: Delhi, Pune and Mumbai.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The price quoted in these three markets is different. As the maximum quantity of grapes is sold in Delhi, the price quoted in Delhi will be considered the fair value of the agricultural produce.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">If an active market does not exist,</span> the entity can use one of the following for the determination of fair value:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The most current market transaction price.</li>
<li>Market prices for similar assets with adjustment to show differences.</li>
<li>Sector benchmark such as the value of cattle expressed per kilogram of meat.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sharman Traders in Nashik are wholesalers of black grapes. If no active market exists for the black grapes, the fair value to be taken in this case will be the most current market transaction price. If no such price exists, then the fair value can be determined on the basis of market prices for similar assets.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Accounting treatment if fair value cannot be determined</span></p>
<p>If the fair value of the biological assets is not determinable, then the biological asset shall be measured at its cost less any accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. Once the fair value of such a biological asset becomes reliably measurable, an entity shall measure it at its fair value less costs to sell.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Treatment of gains and losses</span></p>
<p>A <span class="bold">gain or loss arising on initial recognition of a biological asset </span>that is measured at fair value less costs to sell, should be included in the profit or loss for the period in which it arises. Also, a change in fair value less costs to sell should be included in the profit or loss for the period in which it arises. A gain arising from the birth of offspring should be shown as a gain in the profit or loss.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Moo Co purchased 200 cattle at an auction for $100,000 on 30 June 20X2. An amount of $1,000 was incurred in transporting the cattle. The auctioneer&#x2019;s fees amounted to 1% of sales price. The fair value of the cattle on the date of purchase would be $99,000 ($100,000 - $1,000 auctioneer&#x2019;s fees) and an immediate expense of $2,000 ($1,000 + $1,000) would be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The cattle&#x2019;s fair value increased from $100,000 to $110,000 on 31 December 20X2. At this stage the cattle would be measured at $108,900 ($110,000 &#x2013; $1,100) and a gain of $9,900 ($108,900 - $99,000) would be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Remember that a gain or loss arising on initial recognition of a biological asset and measured at fair value less costs to sell and also the changes in fair value should be included in the profit and loss.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Identify and explain the treatment of government grants, and the presentation and disclosure of information relating to agriculture.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Treatment of government grants</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Government grants are assistance by government in the forms of transfer of resources to any entity in return for past or future compliances with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>Agricultural activity often attracts government support. Government grants are given on the condition that an entity carries out a particular activity. Although there is an international standard on government grants (IAS 20), IAS 41 contains specific guidance in respect of grants receivable in relation to biological assets measured at fair value less costs to sell.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An unconditional government grant is recognised as income when it is receivable.</li>
<li>If a conditional government grant is taken, it shall be recognised as income only when the conditions relating to the grant are satisfied.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Bhatt Company is in the business of cultivating and selling rice. The company has offered grants to growers as an incentive to remain in the industry. The grants will be given at the end of each of the next three years.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">This grant will be recognised at the end of each of the three years, when the grant is receivable.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A government grant may require an entity to farm in a particular location for four years and require the entity to return the entire government grant if it farms for less than four years.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">In this case, the government grant is not recognised as income until four years have passed.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The provisions described above only relate to grants awarded in respect of biological assets measured at fair value less costs to sell. If the biological assets are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses, any government grants related to those assets will be dealt with under IAS 20.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">The IASB amended in June 2014 the way bearer plants are to be treated and presented under the financial statements.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Previous to this IAS 41 Agriculture required all biological assets related to agricultural activity to be measured at fair value less costs to sell. This is based on the principle that the biological transformation that these assets undergo during their lifespan is best reflected by fair value measurement. However, there is a subset of biological assets, known as bearer plants</p>
<p class="boxpara">The amendment now defines a bearer plant as a living plant that:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>is used in the production or supply of agricultural produce;</li>
<li>is expected to bear produce for more than one period; and</li>
<li>has a remote likelihood of being sold as agricultural produce, except for incidental scrap sales.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">All of the above criteria need to be met for a biological asset to be considered a bearer plant.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Under the new amendment the bearer plant will be accounted in the same manner as IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment because their operation is similar to manufacturing. This means the entity has a choice to choose from cost model or revaluation model for bearer plants. The produce growing on bearer plants will remain within the scope of IAS 41 Agriculture and will be accounted based on fair value less cost to sell.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Note: The above distinction is currently applicable to bearer plants and not extended to livestocks that are held for production rather than for its own carcass, for example sheep for wool, chicken and ducks for eggs and dairy cattle for milk..</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Diagram 3: Bearer plants</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p229-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Biological assets include:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>annual crops and plants like wheat, maize, rice, soya, tomatoes, egg plants, trees grown for lumbar, etc., that are harvested plants having twin use (like sweet gum trees) i.e. they are sold as live plants or their agricultural produce (i.e. gum resin) is sold.</li>
