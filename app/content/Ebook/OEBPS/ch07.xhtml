<p class="h3"><span class="bold">IAS 2 Inventories</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Measurement of inventories</span></p>
<p>Having seen the importance of inventories to the final accounts, the next questions that arise are (i) how do we ensure that the amounts disclosed are true and fair; and (ii) how do we measure them, i.e. how do we determine the values to be recognised in the financial statements?</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Inventories </span>shall be measured at <span class="bold">the lower of cost </span>and <span class="bold">net realisable value.</span></p>
</div>
<p>There is a need to understand how to calculate cost and net realisable value.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Cost of inventories</span></p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">1. </span>Costs of purchase</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">2. </span>Costs of conversions</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">3. </span>Other costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">1. </span>Costs of purchase </span>include the following:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">a) </span><span class="bold">Purchase price</span></p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">b) </span><span class="bold">Import duties and other taxes, </span>excluding those subsequently recoverable from taxation authorities</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">c) </span>Transport, handling and other <span class="bold">costs directly attributable </span>to the acquisition of materials, finished goods and services</p>
<p>Trade discounts / rebates are <span class="bold">deducted, </span>if not already deducted from the purchase price.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Saliburtan Ltd purchased raw materials for $125,000 less a rebate of 2%. It paid $25,000 as import duty, including $10,000 towards a special duty. According to local tax laws, it will get a credit of the amount paid towards the special duty, while determining its customs liability. It spent $3,000 on ocean freight, clearing agent&#x2019;s charges of $2,000, $4,000 on warehouse rent and $1,500 on the security guard&#x2019;s salary.</p>

<p class="boxpara">The rent and the security guard&#x2019;s salary are not included as they are not incurred in acquiring the inventory.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Costs of conversion</span></p>
<p>Conversion refers to the change in condition of the material into a finished or saleable product. Conversion costs can be discussed under two broad headings:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Costs directly related to the units of production </span>e.g. a worker spent 6 hours on completing the item; the wages paid to the worker for the time can be directly related to the units of production.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Allocation of production overheads: fixed or variable</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Fixed production overheads</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Allocation is based on normal capacity.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>Normal capacity is the expected average over a number of periods, after taking into account the loss of capacity due to normal maintenance.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>If there is low production, the overhead allocated to each unit is not increased.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iv. </span>Unallocated overheads are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Variable production overheads</span></p>
<p>Allocation of these overheads is based on the actual use of the production facilities.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">At Benjini&#x2019;s Restaurant, the fuel consumed for cooking is a variable overhead (indirect material). For every 100 meals, Benjini needs fuel of $5.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, per meal overhead cost is 5 cents. Benjini uses raw material of $1 and pays wages of 50 cents per unit.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The total variable cost (excluding absorption of fixed overheads) of the product is $1.00 raw material + 0.50 wages + 0.05 variable overheads = $1.55.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Bojour Ltd incurs a fixed production of $1,000,000 every year. Its normal capacity of production is 100,000 units. In the year 2006, 80,000 units were produced and in 2007, 120,000 units were produced.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In 2006 the actual production is short of normal capacity and therefore production overhead will be allocated on basis of normal capacity. Therefore fixed production overhead will be $1,000,000 / 100,000 units = $10 per unit.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In 2007 the actual production is more than the normal capacity and therefore production overhead will be allocated on basis of actual production. Therefore fixed production overhead will be $1,000,000/120,000 units = $8.33 per unit.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Other costs</span></p>
<p>Other costs are included in the cost of inventories to the extent that they are incurred for bringing the inventories to their <span class="bold">present location and condition.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A product is manufactured according to the specifications given by the customer. Material cost is $300,000 and wages are $130,000. Professional fees of $25,000 are paid for having the product designed.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The fees of $25,000, being &#x2018;other&#x2019; costs, are to be added to the cost of the product manufactured. The total costs are:</p>
<p class="boxpara">$300,000 +$130,000 + $25,000 = $455,000</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Costs excluded from the cost of inventory</span></p>
<p>Costs that do not satisfy the above conditions are not included, but are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred. Some instances are:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Abnormal costs </span>such as abnormal wastage of material, labour, and other costs e.g. loss of material by fire, idle time of workers due to machine breakdown.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Storage costs </span>except those that are necessary in the production process before the further production stage.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rent for a warehouse where goods are kept is not included in cost of inventory.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, in a brewery, if a particular alcohol is to be matured by storing it in a special container for a specific period of time, then the cost of that storage may be added to the cost of inventory.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Administrative overheads,</span> except those which are incurred for bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. For example salaries of office staff are not added to the cost of inventory, but salaries of the production accountant can be added, as he is needed for production to occur.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">d) </span>Selling costs: </span>for example commission paid to sales and marketing people should not add to the cost of inventory.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">e) </span>Borrowing costs,</span> except to the extent permitted by IAS 23 Borrowing Costs.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Components of Cost of Inventory</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p134-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Cost formulae</span></p>
<p>A cost formula is needed to determine the value of material issued and material remaining in inventory. The selection of the most appropriate cost formula depends upon the nature of the items.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Specific identification method (for the items not ordinarily interchangeable)</span></p>
<p>This method is applied to items that are <span class="bold">not ordinarily interchangeable </span>and goods and services produced and segregated for <span class="bold">specific projects. Specific costs are attributed </span>to the items of inventory.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">For special made-to-order furniture, the specific costs of material and labour used therein are identified and included in the cost.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Other methods allowable under IAS 2 (for items ordinarily interchangeable)</span></p>
<p>Either of the following two methods is to be used for items not covered under the specific identification method above. This means that the two methods are for ordinarily interchangeable goods and services.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) First In First Out (FIFO)</span></p>
<p>This method assumes that the item which came first into inventory (by way of purchase or production) went out first (as sales or consumption). This means that the items remaining in hand are those which were purchased the last. This is an assumption for the purpose of determining the cost, and the actual movement of the goods may or may not be in that manner. However, generally, the storekeepers ensure that the oldest items are moved out first.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Weighted Average</span></p>
<p>Total cost of material (opening inventory plus subsequent purchases) is divided by the total quantity (opening inventory plus subsequent purchases). This is done either after every purchase or periodically.</p>
<p><img src="images/p135-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>It should be noted that the <span class="bold">Last In, First Out method (LIFO) is not permitted by IAS 2.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The following details are available from Bakers Point Ltd</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p135-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Required:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Determine the value of the inventory as at 8 April 2005 under the FIFO and Weighted Average methods.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">1. FIFO method</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p135-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Value of inventory will be ($300 x 20 + $150 x 22) = $9,300</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">2. Weighted Average method</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p136-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Net realisable value</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Net realisable value </span>is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimated costs necessary to make the sale.</p>
</div>
<p>Costs are compared with the realisable value, since the inventories are to be measured at the lower of the two. This is based on the view that assets should not be carried at a value which is in excess of their realisable value.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p136-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p136-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">At a time, any <span class="bold">ONE </span>method of comparison is used. The above presentation gives all of them together only for your understanding.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Notes:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>A global comparison should not be done, i.e. you cannot compare the grand totals and decide to take the lower of the two i.e. $4,100 as the value of inventory.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Comparing subtotals of P and Q can be done assuming that the similar or related items are grouped together. Therefore, the value of inventory will be $2,620 + $1,480 = 4,100.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">3. </span>Comparing each item separately is the recommended method. Total by this method will be $1,000 + $960 + $340 + $560 + $920 = $3,780, ignoring the subtotal comparison.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Net realisable values are determined after taking into consideration:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span><span class="bold">The </span>most reliable estimates <span class="bold">available.</span></p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Recognition as an expense</span></p>
<p>Inventory may be recognised as an expense when:</p>

<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>The closing inventory is recorded on the credit side of the statement of profit or loss. Hence, recording closing inventory increases the profits. Closing inventory and profits have a direct relationship. If closing inventory is overstated that means profits are also overstated.</p>
<p><img src="images/p139-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>

<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>The closing inventory will be valued at cost or net realisable value; whichever is lower. Hence the calculation of closing inventory is as follows:</p>
