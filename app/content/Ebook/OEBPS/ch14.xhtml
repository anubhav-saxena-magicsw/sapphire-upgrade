<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Understand the term &#x2018;share-based payment&#x2019;.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Share-based payment transaction</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A transaction in which the entity:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>receives goods or services as consideration for equity instruments of the entity (including shares or share options), or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>acquires goods or services by incurring liabilities to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price of the entity&#x2019;s shares or other equity instruments of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>This means, share-based payment involves:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Receipt of goods or services</span></p>
<p>The term &#x2018;goods&#x2019; <span class="bold">include, </span>inventories, consumables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets. Therefore it <span class="bold">excludes financial instruments.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Royal Ltd has invested in 75,000 shares of Quality Ltd. This transaction does not fall within the scope of IFRS 2, as there is no receipt of goods or services by Quality and shares are issued for cash. Cash being a financial asset is specifically excluded from IFRS 2.</p>
</div>
<p>The term &#x2018;services&#x2019; includes:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>services from external agencies</li>
<li>all services provided by employees, including increased productivity commitment or other enhancements in employee work performance as a result of the incentives.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Royal Ltd appointed a legal consultant. He was issued 2,500 equity shares of the company in return for the work carried out. This is a procurement of service by issuing equity shares as consideration. Therefore it is a share-based payment.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">2. Receipt of goods or services </span>in exchange for either of the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">issue </span>of an entity&#x2019;s <span class="bold">equity instruments </span>(including <span class="bold">share options)</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">incurring liabilities </span>to the supplier of goods or services for amounts that are <span class="bold">based on the price </span>of the <span class="bold">entity&#x2019;s shares or other equity instruments.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Equity instrument</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Equity instrument </span>is a contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.</p>
</div>
<p>A detailed explanation of a financial asset and equity instrument is included in Study Guide B7.</p>
<p>Equity instruments include shares and share options.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Share options</span></p>
<p>A share option:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>is a contract that</li>
<li>gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a certain number of shares</li>
<li>is at a predetermined price</li>
<li>is for a specified period of time</li>
<li>the holder of the share option pays to obtain that right</li>
</ul>
<p>The nature of a share option can be explained with the following examples:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Lily Foods offers shares to its employees. The offer is based on the condition that the shares will be transferred in the names of the employees after five years at an exercise price of $10 per share, provided the employees remain in continuous service for these five years. Does this transaction fall within the definition of a share option?</p>
<p class="boxpara">Under the terms of the contract, the employees have a right to subscribe for shares in the company. However, the employees are not under an obligation to subscribe for the shares. Furthermore, the transfer will take place after five years at a predetermined price. Hence this is a share option.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Equity-settled share-based payment transaction</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">share-based payment transaction </span>in which the entity receives goods or services as consideration for equity instruments of the entity (including shares or share options).</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Mars Ltd purchases a printing machine from Jupiter Ltd. The value of the machine is to be paid by Mars Ltd by issuing 35,000 shares of Mars. In this case the goods are received and the consideration is paid for by issue of <span class="bold">equity instruments </span>of Mars Ltd. Therefore it is an equity-settled transaction.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.5 Cash-settled share-based payment transaction</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">share-based payment transaction </span>in which the entity acquires goods or services by incurring a liability to transfer cash or other assets to the supplier of those goods or services for amounts that are based on the price (or value) of <span class="bold">equity instruments </span>(including shares or <span class="bold">share options) </span>of the entity or another group entity.</p>
</div>
<p>In cash-settled transactions, the consideration is paid by a method other than issue of equity instruments but the consideration to be paid is measured based on the value of the entity&#x2019;s shares. Therefore a liability is created.</p>
<p>Remember that in such transactions, the liability is settled by transfer of cash or other assets to the suppliers of those goods or services.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Common examples of cash-settled share-based payment transactions are:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>share appreciation rights to employees and</li>
<li>a right to employees to receive future payments in redeemable shares.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Share appreciation right is an incentive scheme for employees wherein the employee gets the increase in the share price from the date of the grant to the date of the exercise.</p>
</div>
<p>Transactions containing option to settle the obligation either in cash or by issue of equity-instruments</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rogers Ltd acquires forklifts worth $80,000 from Roxy Ltd. Roxy Ltd can choose to settle the transaction by either:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>receiving 200 of the entity&#x2019;s shares two years after delivery; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>receiving a payment equal to the market price of 90 shares at the end of the first year after delivery.</p>
<p class="boxpara">What kind of share-based transaction is this?</p>
<p class="boxpara">Here, the consideration is either transfer of equity shares of the entity or payment equal to the market price of 90 shares Therefore it is a transaction which can be treated either as:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>an equity-settled share-based payment by receiving 200 shares of the entity after two years of delivery; <span class="bold">or </span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>a cash-settled share-based payment, by receiving a payment equal to the market price of 90 shares at the end of the first year after delivery.</p>
</div>
<p class="right"><img src="images/p234-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="ct1"><span class="bold">2. The principles applied to measuring both cash and equity settled share-based payment transactions.</span><br/>
<span class="bold">Computing the amounts that need to be recorded in the financial statement when an entity carries out a transaction where the payment is share-based.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Equity settled share-based transactions</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Recognition of share-based payments</span></p>
<p>Share-based payments are to be recognised in the financial books of the entity as follows:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The expense (or an increase in assets, where relevant) on account of purchase of goods or services is required to be recognised in the financial records of the entity.</li>
<li>The corresponding amount will be recorded either as a liability or as an increase in equity, depending on whether the transaction is determined to be cash or equity settled.</li>
</ul>
<p>For cash-settled transactions,</p>
<p><img src="images/p234-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><img src="images/p235-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sana Ltd buys machinery from Electronics Ltd. The machinery is received by Sana Ltd on 15 January 20X6. The market value for this machine as on 15 January 20X6 is $385,000. The value of the transaction would be determined based on the fair value of the machinery on the date of receipt of the machinery. Hence the value of this transaction is $385,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Ramco Ltd buys a specialised machine from Balloons International. Ramco would issue 25,000 shares to Balloons Ltd. The machine is specialised and not available in India. Balloons Ltd has never sold such a machine earlier. The machine is received on 15 February 20X6. The fair value of the machine is not available. So the value of the transaction would have to be the fair value of the shares of Ramco Ltd as on 15 February 20X6.</p>
</div>
<p>If the entity is <span class="bold">unable to estimate the fair value </span>of the equity instrument granted, the entity should <span class="bold">initially, at the date of receipt </span>of goods or services, <span class="bold">measure it at intrinsic value.</span> In <span class="bold">subsequent periods,</span> on <span class="bold">each reporting date up to the date of final settlement,</span> only the <span class="bold">change in intrinsic value is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Grant date</span></p>
<p>In a share-based payment arrangement, the grant date is the date when there is an understanding between the entity and the counterparty regarding the terms and conditions of the share-based payment arrangement. When the agreement is subject to the approval of certain parties such as shareholders, the grant date would be the date of such approval.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Jupiter Ltd has offered a rights issue at a substantial concession to the fair value to its employees in March 20X6. The issue is subject to the approval of the shareholders. The issue was approved by the shareholders on 15 April 20X6. The grant date is 15 April 20X6.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Vesting</span></p>
<p>Whether or not the entire amount of expense needs to be recorded in the financial books in the year of issue of share options itself will depend on the vesting period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Vesting period: </span>is the period of time <span class="bold">before </span>shares are owned unconditionally by an employee / other e.g. an employee share option plan.</p>
</div>
<p>An equity instrument is said to vest if the conditions on which the issue of the share option was made are satisfied. If it vests immediately, on the grant date, the entity shall recognise the services received in full, with a corresponding increase in equity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Jasmine Ltd made a bonus issue to its employees. This is a situation where the amount of bonus is given for past service. Therefore the equity instrument vests immediately (the shares are owned unconditionally as they are for past work performed by the employee). Therefore the entity shall recognise the share option on the date when the issue is granted.</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes equity instruments are issued subject to fulfilment of certain conditions by the recipient of the equity instruments. The period of time taken for satisfaction of these conditions is referred to as the vesting period. If the equity instruments granted do not vest immediately, the entity shall recognise the services over the entire duration of the vesting period, with <i>a</i> correspondingg increase in equity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Delta Ltd grants share options to its employees. This option is subject to the condition that the employees continue to remain in the services of the company for the next five years. This option does not vest immediately. It will vest subject to the fulfilment of the condition that the employees continue to remain in the services of the company for the next five years. The period of five years is the vesting period. The expense should therefore be recognised over this period of 5 years.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Vesting conditions</span></p>
<p>The recognition of the option expense is dependent on the vesting conditions.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Vesting conditions </span>are the conditions required to be fulfilled for the transfer of the equity instrument to take place.</p>
</div>
<p>In the example of Delta Ltd mentioned above, the vesting condition was a continuous period of service for five years in the company.Vesting conditions are either service conditions or performance conditions. Service conditions require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service.</p>
<p>Performance conditions require the counterparty to complete a specified period of service and specified performance targets are to be met (such as a specified increase in the entity&#x2019;s profit over a specified period of time).</p>
<p>The vesting conditions are classified as:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>market conditions</span></p>
<p>(Include only performance conditions)<br/>
Instances where vesting conditions relate to market conditions:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>outperforming a share price index</li>
<li>achieving total shareholder return</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>other than market conditions</span></p>
<p>(Include service or performance conditions)<br/>
Instances where vesting conditions do not relate to market conditions:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>remaining in employment for a specified period of time</li>
<li>achieving the EPS or profit target</li>
<li>completing a project</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than market condition can be,</p>
<p><span class="bold">Treatment of vesting conditions</span></p>
<p>The treatment of vesting conditions varies depending on <span class="bold">whether or not any of the conditions relate to the market price of the entity&#x2019;s equity instruments.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> Market conditions</span></p>
<p>Market conditions are taken into account while estimating the fair value of the equity instruments granted. Therefore, for grants of equity instruments the entity recognizes the goods or services received from other party which satisfies all the vesting conditions except for market conditions irrespective of whether that market condition is satisfied.</p>
<p><span class="bold"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> Non market conditions</span></p>
<p>If an option has a vesting <span class="bold">condition not relating to the market conditions </span>and there is a change to the conditions, the estimate is only revised. It is revised to the actual number of instruments that vested or are likely to vest.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Vesting conditions</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p237-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Note: </span>remember that if a transaction is subject to a vesting period, no entry will be made on the grant date &#x2013; as it is not due on that date. The accounting entry will be made on the reporting date (when part of the vesting period has expired). </p>
<p><span class="bold">Summary of accounting treatment (where conditions are not market related)</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">At the end of the vesting period,</span></p>
<p class="block1">The cumulative charge = Number of equity instruments that have actually vested x Fair value (excluding effect of market conditions on the date of grant)</p>
<p>Steps to record the transaction</p>
<p><span class="bold">Step 1</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">determine the fair value </span>on grant date</li>
<li>for each subsequent reporting period until the vesting period, the entity will <span class="bold">calculate cumulative charge </span>as follows:</li>
</ul>
<p class="block1">Cumulative expenses = Fair Value on date of grant x Estimate of the number of options that will vest x Expired portion of vested period</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Calculate the charge to the statement of profit or loss for the current year using:</li>
</ul>
<p>Cumulative expenses &#x2013; Amounts already charged in the previous periods.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Jupiter Ltd has offered share options of 200 shares to each of its 1,000 employees. The vesting condition is that the employees need to remain in continuous employment for the next five years. The estimated fair value of each share option is $30. The entity estimates that 25% of the employees will leave the organisation during the five-year period.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Based on the explanation given above the following amounts are to be recognised in the financial statements:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Step 1 </span>Fair value on grant date = 200 x 1,000 x 30 = 6,000,000</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p237-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Step 3 </span>Expense for the period:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Amount calculated in 2 &#x2013; Amount charged in previous period</li>
<li>Year 1: 900,000 - 0 = 900,000</li>
<li>Year 2: 1,800,000 - 900,000 = 900,000</li>
<li>Year 3: 2,700,000 - 1,800,000 = 900,000</li>
<li>Year 4: 3,600,000 - 2,700,000 = 900,000</li>
<li>Year 5: 4,500,000 - 3,600,000 = 900,000</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">* The entity expects that 25% of the employees will leave so the options that will vest are 75% (as considered in step 2 above).</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Cash-settled share-based payments</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Cash-settled share-based payments</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p238-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">The cash-settled share-based payment transactions </span>are measured at <span class="bold">the fair value of the liability incurred.</span></p>
<p>The fair value of the liability incurred in respect of a cash-settled transaction is re-measured at each reporting date until the date of settlement. Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The rules for determining vesting period are quite similar for equity-settled share-based payment and cash-settled share-based payment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Summary of accounting treatment for cash-settled share-based payments</span></p>
<p>Ultimate cost is actual cash paid by the reporting entity = Fair value at settlement date.</p>
<p>Cumulative cost recognised until settlement represents a liability.</p>
<p>The determination of the liability is as follows:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>At each reporting date between the grant date and settlement date - determine the fair value of the liability</li>
<li>During the vesting period, the liability recognised at each reporting period =Fair value of the liability x Expired portion for the vesting period.</li>
<li>From the end of the vesting period, the liability recognised is the full fair value of liability on the reporting date.</li>
<li>Changes in liability are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company granted share appreciation rights (to be settled in cash) to its 100 employees in March 20X2, vesting in March 20X5. The following estimates were made by management in March 20X1:</p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>Statement 1 is <span class="bold">false. </span>This transaction does not fall within the scope of IFRS 2, as there is no receipt of goods or services by Nicky Ltd and shares are issued for cash. Cash being a financial asset is specifically excluded from IFRS 2.</p>
<p>Statement 2 is <span class="bold">true. </span>As Loyal Ltd issued 500 equity shares of the company in return for the service Mr Harry carried out. This is a procurement of service. Therefore it is a share-based payment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>In this case the forklifts are received and the consideration is paid for by issue of <span class="bold">equity instruments </span>of Carter Ltd. Therefore it is an equity-settled transaction.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>The measurement date under IFRS 2 is 30 March 2013. For transactions with parties other than employees (and those providing similar services), the measurement date is defined as &#x201C;the date the entity obtains the goods or the counterparty renders service.&quot; Therefore, the 5000 shares would be valued on 30 March 2013 based on current market prices.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>The options will be treated as follows: 3,000 options x 2 chief officers x $10 share price x 1/3 years = $20,000</p>
<p>Equity will be credited by $20,000 and an expense of $20,000 will be shown in the statement of profit or loss for the year ended 31 March 2012.</p>
<p>The market-based condition (i.e. the increase in the share price) can be ignored for the purpose of the calculation. However the employment condition must be taken into account.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>1,400 SAR&#x2019;s x (900 employees &#x2013; 150 employees) x $9 x 1/3 = $3,150,000</p>
