<p>Revenue is something that every business entity would like to have more and more of. It is often a sign that the business is growing; it is also one of the most important factors being analysed by the financial analysts and other stakeholders. It's simple to state that you should recognise revenue on an accrual basis when it arises, but the problem is identifying the point when it arises. For small traders this can be a simple issue but for businesses like real estate, construction contracts, information technology, tele-communication and many others, deciding the point of recognition and the quantum of revenue to be recognised can be a complex issue. If there are no proper guidelines available for revenue recognition and there is no consistency, the comparison of financial performance of entities can be misleading.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that you are a dealer in construction equipment. You receive an order to sell specialised machinery on 28 December 2015 and to provide servicing for the next five years. A single consolidated amount was agreed as consideration for machinery and servicing. The customer would like delivery by the end of January 2016. Your year end is 31 December. Without the proper guidance, you may be tempted to book the revenue in 2015 itself for both the sale of machinery and servicing as it is going to show a higher revenue figure and therefore make your business look better. However, in reality, as the machine will be delivered in January and the servicing will be provided in the coming years, the revenue related to the services shall not be recognised immediately. This Study Guide provides guidance on when and how much revenue should be recognised in such a scenario</p>
<p>IFRS 15 gives specific guidelines about the timing of revenue recognition. The principles of timing of revenue recognition need to be carefully understood as an incorrect interpretation will lead to errors in the financial statements.</p>
<p>Understanding this Study Guide will ensure that you never face problems recognising when revenue should be accounted for!</p>
