<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Why an accounting standard on provisions is necessary.</span><a href="videos/Provision 1.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>IAS 37 - <span class="bold">provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets </span>prescribes clear-cut rules and guidance in respect of the recognition and measurement of provisions, contingent liabilities, and contingent assets. It also makes certain disclosures mandatory for the companies because of which it becomes difficult for them to manipulate the financial reports with the help of provisions. With the issue of IAS 37, companies have to follow the rules and hence, the above mentioned manipulations can be minimised.</p>
<p>In addition to this, IAS 37 has clarified certain misconceptions about the term &#x2018;provisions&#x2019;. For example, there was confusion about the term provision (according to IAS 37) and the terms such as &#x2018;provision for depreciation&#x2019; and &#x2018;provision for doubtful debts&#x2019;. The standard clarified that &#x2018;provision for depreciation&#x2019; and &#x2018;provision for doubtful debts&#x2019; are really not provisions according to this Standard. In fact, these are the contra accounts or adjustments to the carrying value of assets.</p>
<p>Furthermore, provision as defined by IAS 37 will be of the nature of liability. The item which qualifies as provision needs to be accounted for in the statement of financial position as a liability. Earlier, the companies did not recognise the liability due to the uncertainty of its timing or amount. This has been clarified by IAS 37.</p>
<p>The standard has not only helped the companies but also the stakeholders who are interested in the financial matters of the company. The stakeholders can be benefited by the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Transparency in the information presented in the financial reports</li>
<li>Precision and clarity of the information for users</li>
<li>Keeping pace with global developments in the accounting field</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">1.1 </span>In the <span class="bold">absence </span>of a standard on provisions, a company could manipulate its results in the following manner:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>A company which has made a substantial profit initially, but which is not confident of sustaining that high level of profitability in later years, could <span class="bold">make a huge provision </span>in the financial year in which it makes substantial profit. This would result in reducing the profit for that year. The amount of provision could be gradually reversed in subsequent years, when the profit earned is not at the level which the company would desire, in order to show consistency / steady growth in financial performance.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>A company which has not made the profits if desires to report a better financial picture <span class="bold">could decide not to make a provision </span>which, in the ordinary course of affairs, it should make. Not reporting provisions makes the profit seem higher. In subsequent years, if the financial position of the company improves, only then would it make the provision which it should have made earlier.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Fun Games Inc has had a lean year (where profits were lower than expected), but it is confident that the new video game which should be ready for release in the next year will turn around the fortunes of the company.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Fun Games Inc is aware that it should make a provision for warranty claims. If there were no accounting standard on provisions, then Fun Games Inc would not make the provision for warranty claims in its lean year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This provision would be made in the next year, when its profitability had improved.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>If a company wishes to <span class="bold">report a lower loss </span>than the <span class="bold">actual loss </span>it has incurred, then it will <span class="bold">not make a provision which it should make.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>If a company wishes to <span class="bold">report a loss which is more </span>than the <span class="bold">actual loss </span>it has incurred, then it will <span class="bold">make a provision for a bigger amount than necessary.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span><span class="bold">Providing for the restructuring of a business </span>is one area that was previously used by companies to manipulate their results.</p>
<p>An accounting standard on provisions:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Became essential to rule out the potential for companies to manipulate results </li>
<li>Ensures that <span class="bold">unintentional errors </span>in accounting for provisions <span class="bold">are eliminated.</span></li>
<li>Ensures provisions are made on <span class="bold">valid grounds.</span></li>
<li>Ensures provisions of the <span class="bold">correct amount are made.</span></li>
<li>Ensures provisions are <span class="bold">not included / excluded in order to manipulate financial results.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. How the provisions should be accounted for.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Provisions </span>are liabilities of <span class="bold">uncertain timing </span>or <span class="bold">amount.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">liability </span>is a <span class="bold">present obligation </span>of the entity arising from <span class="bold">past events,</span> the settlement of which is expected to result in <span class="bold">an outflow from </span>the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 When provisions may be made</span></p>
<p>A liability can be provided for only when <span class="bold">all the following conditions </span>(known as the <span class="bold">recognition criteria) </span><span class="bold">are fulfilled:</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>An entity has <span class="bold">a present obligation </span>(legal or constructive) <span class="bold">as a result of a past event.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sure, a bookseller sells books with a guarantee that if the books sold by him are returned within one month of sale, then the amount paid by the buyer for the book will be returned &#x2013; no questions will be asked.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, Sure has <span class="bold">a present obligation </span>to return the amount paid by the buyer, within one month of sale. This obligation is <span class="bold">a result of a past event </span>(the sale of books).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>It is <span class="bold">probable </span>(which means it is more likely to happen than not) that an <span class="bold">outflow of resources, embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, it is probable that some buyers will return the book within one month. As the terms state that no questions will be asked on return of books, Sure Co will have to return the amount to the buyer.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Settlement of the obligation </span>by Sure Co, will obviously lead to an <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits </span>(i.e. cash returned to the buyer).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>A <span class="bold">reliable estimate </span>can be made of the <span class="bold">amount of the obligation.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, Sure Co can make a <span class="bold">reliable estimate </span>of the <span class="bold">amount of the obligation. </span>In order to make a reasonable estimate, it will rely on past records, to see what percentage of books have been returned.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In any case, the total provision will not exceed the total of the last month&#x2019;s sales figures.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>The above mentioned conditions can be remembered with the help of the following mnemonic:</p>
<p><span class="bold">P<small><sup>3</sup></small> + E</span><br/>
Where,<br/>
P = <span class="bold">P</span>resent obligation<br/>
P = as a result of <span class="bold">P</span>ast event<br/>
P = <span class="bold">P</span>robable that outflow of resources, embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation<br/>
E = reliable <span class="bold">E</span>stimate can be made of the amount of the obligation</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">When provisions may not be made</span></p>
<p>If there is a situation where <span class="bold">even one condition </span>of the recognition criteria <span class="bold">is not fulfilled,</span> then it <span class="bold">does not constitute a liability which has to be provided for.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Let us see what happens in the following situations:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>A company is planning to give training to its employees to improve their leadership skills.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case;</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation i.e. </span>the training cost<span class="bold">.</span></li>
<li>A <span class="bold">reliable estimate can </span>be made of the <span class="bold">amount of the obligation.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">However:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">This is not a present obligation based on a past event </span>in the ordinary course of the business &#x2013; the training has not started yet. Also, the company has not yet entered into a contract with any training provider.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, the training cost cannot be recognised as liability.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The case for damages for breach of contract against the company is pending in the court. The lawyers have advised that there are 75% chances of the company winning the case.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>A <span class="bold">reliable estimate can </span>be made of the <span class="bold">amount of the obligation &#x2013; i.e. the </span>amount of penalty<span class="bold">.</span></li>
<li>The obligation is based on the <span class="bold">past event </span>&#x2013; breach of contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">However,</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits </span>that will be required to settle the obligation <span class="bold">is not certain. </span>This means as the court has not finalised the decision yet, there are chances that the company may or may not win the case. The outflow will be decided on the basis of the court&#x2019;s decision.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The obligation is not a present obligation. Although it is based on the past event, the amount is not payable yet (at the end of the year).</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, these penalty charges cannot be provided for in the books.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>The company has launched a new product in the market with 3 years replacement warranty in the case of defects.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case;</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation </span>&#x2013; i.e. replacement cost for the defective pieces.</li>
<li><span class="bold">This is a present obligation based on a past event </span>in the ordinary course of the business &#x2013; sale of goods.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">However,</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">reliable estimate cannot </span>be made of the <span class="bold">amount of the obligation. </span>The company is not aware of the number of defective pieces and the nature of the defect as well. As the product is new, the company does not have past data based on which it can estimate the replacement cost.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, in theory, in this case the warranty charges cannot be provided for in the financial statements. Practically, though the company may make estimates based on technical experts&#x2019; opinion and past experience of similar products.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Accounting for provisions</span></p>
<p><img src="images/p173-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. How provisions should be measured.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 The best estimate</span></p>
<p>According to Para 36 of IAS 37, the amount recognised as a provision shall be the <span class="bold">best estimate </span>of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation at the statement of financial position date.</p>
<p>The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is the amount that an entity would rationally pay to settle the obligation at the end of the reporting period or to transfer it to a third party at that time.</p>
<p>The best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the present obligation is determined by any or all of the following ways together:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the judgement of the management of the entity;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>experience of similar transactions;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>reports from independent experts.</p>
<p>The standard provides guidance relating to measurement of provisions which are on account of uncertainties.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The best estimate of the provisions can be determined as follows:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span><span class="bold">Expected value: </span>for the measurement of a large population of items</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span><span class="bold">Most likely outcome: </span>for the measurement of a single obligation</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Reimbursements</span></p>
<p>If a company is virtually certain that another party will reimburse the expenditure required to settle the liability, then this amount of <span class="bold">&#x2018;receivable reimbursement&#x2019; </span>is recognised in the financial statements in the following manner:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>As a separate <span class="bold">asset in the statement of financial position.</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">Deducted from the amount of expense </span>and the <span class="bold">net amount of expense is transferred to the statement of profit or loss</span></li>
</ul>
<p>However, the amount recognised for reimbursement cannot be more than the amount of provision.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Changes in provisions</span></p>
<p>Provisions are <span class="bold">reassessed at the end of each reporting period </span>and <span class="bold">adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.</span></p>
<p>If it is <span class="bold">no longer probable </span>that an <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the provision </span>has to be <span class="bold">reversed.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Wine Co has signed a contract with its employees under which it has agreed to pay a long service incentive of $5,000 to employees who stay with the company for a period of more than three years.</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 31 December 20X8, four employees are eligible for this incentive and accordingly a provision of $20,000 is made in the accounts of that year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In 20X9, all the four employees are accused of embezzling company funds and are fired.</p>
<p class="boxpara">As an <span class="bold">outflow of resources embodying economic benefits </span>will <span class="bold">probably not </span>be <span class="bold">required </span>to <span class="bold">settle the obligation,</span> the provision of $20,000 made earlier <span class="bold">will now be reversed,</span> and a <span class="bold">new provision will not be made.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The accounting entries will be:</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Provisions has been defined under paragraph 2.1 above</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">obligating event </span>is an event that creates a legal or constructive obligation that results in an entity having no realistic alternative to settling that obligation.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 Legal obligations</span></p>
<p>A <span class="bold">legal obligation </span>is an obligation that a company derives because of:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a contract (through its explicit or implicit terms);</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>legislation; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>other operation of law.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.3 Constructive obligations</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">constructive obligation </span>is an obligation that a company derives because of an entity&#x2019;s actions, where:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>by an established pattern of past practice, published policies or a sufficiently specific current statement, the entity has indicated to other parties that it will accept certain responsibilities; and</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>as a result, the entity has created a valid expectation on the part of those other parties that it will discharge those responsibilities. </p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">House Providers Inc has been in the business of constructing houses for the last 20 years. Its practice has been to maintain the housing colonies it constructs for a period of one year after the date of handing them over. This policy is not written anywhere, nor does the company make such a commitment at the time of sale.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, this liability has to be provided for, as it is a <span class="bold">constructive obligation </span>which House Providers Inc has derived <span class="bold">because of an established pattern of past practice,</span> which its customers expect with full certainty that it will discharge.</p>
</div>
<p>There is <span class="bold">one point of similarity </span>between the two types of obligations:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Non-performance </span>in both cases will lead to a <span class="bold">fall in the credibility of the company,</span> and may affect its business.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.4 Restructuring provisions</span></p>
<p>Restructuring provisions were used by some companies to manipulate their results; therefore IAS 37 specifically lays down the accounting requirements in this area.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">restructuring </span>is a programme that is planned and controlled by management, and materially changes either:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The scope of a business undertaken by an entity; or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The manner in which that business is conducted.</p>
</div>
<p>In the absence of a standard, <span class="bold">a mere management decision to restructure the business </span>would be taken as a <span class="bold">basis for inclusion / non-inclusion of a provision.</span></p>
<p>The following are examples of events that may fall under the definition of restructuring, as specified in the this IAS:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>sale or termination of a line of business</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the closure of business locations in a country or region or the relocation of business activities from one country or region to another</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>changes in management structure, for example, eliminating a layer of management</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>fundamental reorganisations that have a material effect on the nature and focus of the entity&#x2019;s operations</p>
<p><span class="bold">According to para 72 of IAS 37, a</span>n entity is required to recognise the constructive obligations for restructuring if the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a formal plan exists</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a valid expectation that it will carry out the restructuring exists</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Measurement of restructuring provisions:</span></p>
<p>A restructuring provision <span class="bold">shall include </span>only the direct expenditure arising from the restructuring, which are those that are both:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>necessarily entailed by the restructuring; and</li>
<li>not associated with the ongoing activities of the entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>A restructuring provision <span class="bold">does not include </span>such costs as:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>retraining or relocating continuing staff;</li>
<li>marketing; or</li>
<li>investment in new systems and distribution networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This expenditure relates to the future conduct of the business and are not liabilities for restructuring at the end of the reporting period. Such expenditure are recognised on the same basis as if they arose independently of a restructuring.</p>
<p>Identifiable <span class="bold">future operating losses </span>up to the date of a restructuring are <span class="bold">not included </span>in a provision, unless they relate to an onerous contract.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Gains on the expected disposal of assets are not taken into account </span>in measuring a restructuring provision, even if the sale of assets is envisaged as part of the restructuring.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">5. Define contingent assets and liabilities.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.1 Contingent liability</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Meaning</span></p>
<p>A <span class="bold">contingent liability </span>is derived when any of the following situations occur:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span></span>a <span class="bold">possible obligation </span>arises from <span class="bold">past events </span>and its <span class="bold">existence will be confirmed </span>only by the <span class="bold">occurrence or non-occurrence </span>of one or more <span class="bold">uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Play Well Co has become a guarantor of a loan of $50,000 taken by its associate company Play Fine Co from the bank. The outstanding balance of the loan on the statement of financial position date is $25,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">There is <span class="bold">a past event:</span> Play Well Co has given a guarantee.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, the <span class="bold">possible obligation </span>will <span class="bold">arise </span>only if Play Fine Co <span class="bold">does not honour its commitment. </span>It is an <span class="bold">uncertain event not wholly within the control of Play Well Co.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, this is a <span class="bold">contingent liability.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a present obligation exists that arises from past events,</span> but it cannot be recognised because:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation or</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.</p>
<p>When there is a present obligation arising from past event and the <span class="bold">amount of obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability,</span> it is a <span class="bold">provision. </span>However, when the amount <span class="bold">cannot be measured with sufficient reliability,</span> it is a <span class="bold">contingent liability.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Accounting treatment</span></p>
<p>Contingent liabilities are <span class="bold">not provided for </span>in the accounts. This means that they are <span class="bold">not reflected </span>in the financial statements.</p>
<p>When a contingent liability exists whose settlement is not remote, then (in its financial statements) the entity has to disclose a brief description of the nature of the contingent liability, along with:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>an estimate of its financial effect;</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.2 Contingent asset</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Meaning</span></p>
<p>A contingent asset is a <span class="bold">possible asset </span>that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Amanda Co has filed a legal suit of $3 million against Bermuda Ltd for Bermuda&#x2019;s non-performance of duties.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The entity received a favourable judgement and if Bermuda appeals against the judgement to a higher court, then $3million will be disclosed in the financial statements as a contingent asset because</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>There is <span class="bold">a past event </span>&#x2013; Amanda received a favourable judgement.</li>
<li>However, Amanda Co will be paid for this transaction only if an <span class="bold">uncertain future event occurs which is not wholly within the control of the entity </span>(the higher court needs to give a favourable judgement).</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, this is a <span class="bold">contingent asset.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">If Bermuda had not appealed to the high court, then </span>$3 million would be recognised in the financial statements as an accounts receivable.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Accounting treatment</span></p>
<p>Contingent assets are <span class="bold">not recognised </span>in the accounts as it may result in recognising income that may never actually be realised. This means that they are <span class="bold">not reflected </span>in the financial statements. However, if the entity is <span class="bold">virtually certain that income will be realised,</span> then the related asset is no more a contingent asset. It is an actual asset <span class="bold">to be recognised in the financial statements.</span></p>
<p>Where an <span class="bold">inflow of economic benefits is probable,</span> an entity shall disclose:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a brief description of the nature of the contingent assets on the end of the reporting period; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>if possible, an estimate of their financial effect on the financial statements of the entity.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">6. Identify and account for</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Onerous contracts;</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>Environmental and similar provisions.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.1 Onerous contracts</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Identification</span></p>
<p>An <span class="bold">onerous contract </span>is a contract in which the <span class="bold">unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations </span>under the contract <span class="bold">exceed the economic benefit expected to be received </span>under the contract.</p>
<p>In simple terms, it means that the company will make a loss on the contract no matter what.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The liabilities </span>derived from <span class="bold">onerous contracts have to be provided for </span>as onerous contracts <span class="bold">fulfil all the three conditions of the recognition criteria.</span></p>

<p class="boxpara">Alpha Ltd is a retailer of perfumes and is bound by the franchise agreement for a local brand that it has marketed for the past several years. Based on the market survey and a cost-benefit study, it decided to stop marketing the local brand and entered into a new agreement to market an international brand.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Although Alpha does not derive any economic benefit from the franchise agreement for the local brand, there is an obligation to pay a lump-sum amount to the franchiser under the franchise agreement for a period of two years.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Thus Alpha needs to make a provision for the charges under the franchise agreement. This is an onerous contract.</p>

<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 1 January 20X9, a mining company signs a contract with the government in which it is given the permission to carry out its excavating operations for five years. At the end of this period, the mine has to be filled up again and the entire land has to be landscaped. The present value of the cost of such landscaping is expected to be $2,000,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The liability of $2,000,000 has to be provided for in the first year itself, when the mining company begins its excavation work.</p>
<p class="boxpara">It cannot be provided for gradually over the five years of the mining operations, or in the fifth year (that is, at the end of the excavation work), because a liability has to be recognised as soon as the entity performs any operation affected by these environmental laws.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">7.1 Provisions for future repairs or refurbishments</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">There is no present obligation for future repairs or refurbishments. </span>This is because, it is possible that:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The asset is sold off before the future repairs / refurbishment becomes due.</li>
<li>The entity decides to keep the asset idle, rather than repair / refurbish it.</li>
<li>The entity decides to use the asset without doing the necessary repairs / refurbishment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, no provision can be made for future repairs or refurbishments.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Some assets are required to be repaired or refurbished regularly and this involves major expenditure. There is neither a constructive nor a legal obligation. If a furnace whose lining has to be changed every five years, and it has already been used for three years, there is no need for a provision as there is no obligation as the entity may change the furnace itself, or decide against changing the lining and keep it idle or continue to use the furnace without changing the lining.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, no provision is recognised in this case. Instead of a provision, depreciation of lining takes account of its consumption (this component will be fully depreciated by the time relining is due) and relining costs can be capitalised.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">7.2 Unwinding of discount</span></p>
<p>An increase in the liability that reflects the passage of time is referred to as the unwinding of the discount. The periodic unwinding of the discount shall be recognised in profit or loss as a finance cost as it occurs. Its capitalisation under IAS 23 is not permitted.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Decommissioning costs expected to be incurred for a plant at the end of 40 years are $217,200. At an 8% discount, the present value of the amount of $217,200 is $10,000. This amount is added to the cost of the plant today and recognised as a liability.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Every year, an amount calculated at 8% is added to this liability and recognised as a finance cost.</p>
<p class="boxpara">During Year 1, finance cost is 10,000 x 8% = 800 and the closing liability = $10,800 (10,000 +800)</p>
<p class="boxpara">During Year 2, finance cost is 10,800 x 8% = 864 and the closing liability = $11,664 (10,800 +864)</p>
<p class="boxpara">And so on. This process continues until the 40<small><sup>th</sup></small> year, when the liability will increase to $217,200.</p>

<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>Since (i), (ii) and (iii) are required to be satisfied before a provision can be recognised.</p>
<p>The condition outlined in iv is not accurate as it states that the uncertain events are within the entity&#x2019;s control. If it were to say that the events are beyond the entity&#x2019;s control, it would sill be a condition to be fulfilled for a contingent liability and not a provision.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Peter Ltd will have to make a provision for warranty claims.</p>
<p>This is because there is a past event &#x2013; Peter Ltd has sold the mobile phones. It has a legal obligation to settle warranty claims &#x2013; according to the terms of sale. Settlement of warranty claims is going to lead to an outflow of economic resources. The amount of obligation can be measured with sufficient reliability &#x2013; 5% of revenue. Therefore provision for warranty needs to be provided.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>A provision is required for onerous contracts as it creates a present obligation. Future operating losses do not create a present obligation and therefore do not satisfy the definition of a provision in accordance with IAS 37.</p>
