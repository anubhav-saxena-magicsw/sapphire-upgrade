<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Define and apply the definition of related parties in accordance with international accounting standards.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Definition of related party</span></p>
<p>IAS 24, in its definition of related party, lists all scenarios where a party can be said to be related to another.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A related party is a person or entity that is related to the entity that is preparing its financial statements (referred to as the &#x2018;reporting entity&#x2019;).</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>A person or a close member of that person&#x2019;s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>has control or joint control over the reporting entity;</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>has significant influence over the reporting entity; or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>An entity is related to a reporting entity if any of the following conditions applies:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>The entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group (which means that each parent, subsidiary and fellow subsidiary is related to the others).</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>One entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member).</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>Both entities are joint ventures of the same third party.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iv. </span>One entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">v. </span>The entity is a post-employment defined benefit plan for the benefit of employees of either the reporting entity or an entity related to the reporting entity. If the reporting entity is itself such a plan, the sponsoring employers are also related to the reporting entity.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">vi. </span>The entity is controlled or jointly controlled by a person identified in (a).</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">vii. </span>A person identified in (a) (i) has significant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnel of the entity (or of a parent of the entity).</p>
<p class="boxpara">The following are not deemed to be related:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>two entities simply because they have a director or key manager in common</li>
<li>two ventures who share joint control over a joint venture</li>
<li>providers of finance, trade unions, public utilities, and departments and agencies of a government that does not control, jointly control or significantly influence the reporting entity, simply by virtue of their normal dealings with an entity (even though they may affect the freedom of action of an entity or participate in its decision-making process)</li>
<li>a single customer, supplier, franchiser, distributor, or general agent with whom an entity transacts a significant volume of business merely by virtue of the resulting economic dependence.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 The significant portions of the definition of related party are analysed below:</span></p>
<p>A person or a close member of that person&#x2019;s family is related to a reporting entity if that person:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>has control or joint control over the reporting entity;</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>has significant influence over the reporting entity; or</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>is a member of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Close family members </span>of the family of the individual refers to &#x201C;those family members who may be expected to influence or be influenced by that individual in their dealings with that entity&#x201D;.</p>
</div>
<p>They may include:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i </span>the individual&#x2019;s domestic partner and children</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii </span>children of the individual&#x2019;s domestic partner</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii </span>dependants of the individual or the individual&#x2019;s domestic partner</p>
<p>The above list is not exhaustive. It could include other family members such as brothers, sisters, parents and so on if the family member has an influence in their dealings with the entity<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The individuals referred to above therefore include those who have control, significant influence or joint control over the entity or are members of the key management personnel of the reporting entity or of a parent of the reporting entity.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Mr Patman owns 65% of the shares of Valley Plastics and Mrs Patman (the wife of Mr. Patman) own 100% of the shares of City Plastics.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Mrs Patman is a close family member of Mr Patman and she has control over City Plastics, so in the financial statements of Valley Plastics, City Plastics is a related party.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Similarly, as Mrs Patman is a close family member of Mr Patman, and Mr Patman owns 65% of the shares of Valley Plastics, in the financial statements of City Plastics, Valley Plastics is a related party.</p>
<p class="boxpara">If Mrs Patman were to own only 10% shares in City Plastics she would not have had a significant influence over City Plastics.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>An entity is related to the reporting entity if the entity and the reporting entity are members of the same group</span></p>
<p>A group is defined as a &#x2018;parent and all its subsidiaries&#x2019; A subsidiary is an entity, including an unincorporated entity such as a partnership, that is controlled by another entity (known as the parent).</p>
<p><span class="bold">Control</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Control of an investee - An investor controls an investee when the investor is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.</p>
</div>
<p>As per IFRS 10 control involves:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Power</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Exposure to variability in returns</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Link between power and returns</p>
<p>Power is defined as existing rights that give the current ability to direct the relevant activities.</p>
<p>Thus, for the existence of parent and subsidiary relationship an entity (Parent) should be in a position to exercise power over another entity (Subsidiary), the returns expected as a result of these power is variable and there is a link between power exercised and returns.</p>
<p>Control needs to be reassessed as and when there are changes in circumstances based on which the control is assessed. There is also a need to verify activities over which the power can be exercised.</p>
<p>An entity is related to the reporting entity if:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>one entity is an associate or joint venture of the other entity (or an associate or joint venture of a member of a group of which the other entity is a member)</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>both entities are joint ventures of the same third party</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>one entity is a joint venture of a third entity and the other entity is an associate of the third entity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Associate</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An associate is an entity over which the investor has significant influence.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The concept of associate company has been explained in Study Guide D2.</span></p>
<p>The following diagram will help to recapitulate the concept.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Formation of associate enterprises</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/308-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Significant influence is </span>the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over those policies.</p>
</div>
<p>A party is related to an entity if the party is an <span class="bold">associate </span>(as defined in IAS 28 Investments in Associates) of the entity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Joint venture</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">joint venture </span>is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. Those parties are called joint venturers.</p>
</div>
<p>To have joint control, it is essential to have the unanimous<span class="bold"> consent </span>of the parties sharing control <span class="bold">before any financial or operating decision can be taken.</span> The contract may decide that one party is the operator of the joint venture. This does not mean that the operator has more control than the others.</p>
<p>However, if one venturer has more control than the others it means that the activity is not a joint venture. It means that one venturer has control of the other entity<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p>A party is related to an entity if the party is a <span class="bold">joint venture </span>in which the entity is a venturer (see IFRS 11 Join Arrangements).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Key Management personnel are the persons who have authority and responsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">3. </span>Key management personnel include all directors, including non-executive directors of the entity and its parent.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Mr Rai is a full-time director of Mona Foods Ltd and also owns 70% of the shares of Roma Foods Ltd. Therefore, Mr. Rai is a member of the key management personnel of Mona Foods Ltd.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Since he has 70% of the shares of Roma Foods Ltd he controls the activities of Roma Foods Ltd. Therefore in the financial statements of Mona Foods Ltd, both Mr. Rai and Roma Foods Ltd are related parties.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the financial statements of Roma Foods, Mr. Rai and Mona Foods are related parties.</p>

<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p>Remember, while determining whether a party is related or not, substance of the relationship should be considered and not merely the legal form. This means that to become a related party, the party should be in a position to influence the decision making power of the reporting entity.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. The disclosure requirements for related party transactions.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Disclosure requirements</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">Regardless of whether there have been transactions between a parent and a subsidiary, an entity must disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate controlling party. If neither the entity&#x2019;s parent nor the ultimate controlling party produces financial statements available for public use, the name of the next most senior parent that does so must also be disclosed.</p>

<p class="boxpara">Related party disclosures:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/310-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, disclosures have been made with respect to the names of the parent company, subsidiary companies, identification of relationships and the names of the key management personnel.</p>
<p class="boxpara">These disclosures are required by the accounting standard.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>If there have been transactions between related parties, a reporting entity shall disclose:</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>

<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">g) </span><span class="bold">other related parties.</span></p>
<p>The above example makes disclosures with respect to each of the entities and individuals mentioned above.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Disclosures that related party transactions were made on terms equivalent to those that occur in arm&#x2019;s length transactions are made only if such terms can be substantiated.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>The following are examples of transactions that are disclosed if they are with a related party:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>purchases or sales of goods (finished or unfinished)</li>
<li>purchases or sales of property and other assets</li>
<li>rendering or receiving of services</li>
<li>leases</li>
<li>transfers for research and development</li>
<li>transfers under licence agreements</li>
<li>transfers under finance arrangements (including loans and equity contributions in cash or in kind)</li>
<li>provision of guarantees or collateral</li>
<li>settlement of liabilities on behalf of the entity or by the entity on behalf of another party</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span>The previous version of IAS 24 did not specify exemption for government-related entities. Many entities, particularly in an environment where government control is pervasive, found it problematic in practice to identify all government-related entities, and to quantify all related party transactions and balances with those entities. The revised IAS 24 exempts a reporting entity from disclosure requirements (discussed above in point 2) in relation to related party transactions and outstanding balances, including commitments, with:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>a government company that has control, joint control or significant influence over the reporting entity</li>
<li>any other entity that is a related party because the same government company that has control, joint control or significant influence over both the reporting entity and the other entity.</li>
</ul>
<p>Para 26 of IAS 24 requires that if the above exemptions are applied the following disclosures should be made:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>name of the government company and its relationship with the reporting company</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the following information in sufficient detail:</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> the nature and amount of each significant individual transaction; and</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> for the other transactions which are collectively but not individually significant, a quantitative and qualitative description of their extent.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/312-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">The Government Company directly or indirectly controls entities A and B and entities P, Q, R and S.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the financial statements of entity P, the following transactions will be exempted under para 26 of IAS 24:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>transactions with the Government company; and</li>
<li>transactions with entities A and B and entities Q, R and S.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">The disclosure requirements for SMEs are similar to the requirements of IAS 24, except for certain relief which is provided in the case of the disclosure of certain related party transactions. The compensation of key management personnel need to be disclosed in total and the category-wise breakup as required in IAS 24 need not be given.</p>
<p class="boxpara">SMEs have to disclose a parent-subsidiary relationship. However they are exempt from disclosing the amount of transactions, outstanding balances and provision for uncollectable bad debts during the year for the following entities:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>state government (a national, regional or local government) that has control, joint control or significant influence over the reporting entity, and</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>another entity that is a related party because the same state government has control, joint control or significant influence over both the reporting entity and the other entity.</p>
