<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">intangible asset </span>is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 The classification of assets</span></p>
<p>From the perspective of physical existence, assets can be of two types, tangible (with physical substance) and intangible (without physical substance). </p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 The nature of an intangible asset</span></p>
<p>The general meaning of &#x2018;intangible&#x2019; is &#x2018;without physical substance&#x2019;. There are some assets that may not have a physical substance, but are still a valuable resource for an entity. They enable the business to run and earn profits in the same manner as tangible assets do.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity uses a machine to manufacture a product. The design of the product is &#x2018;patented&#x2019; i.e. registered with the patent office. A &#x2018;patent&#x2019; means an exclusive right over certain design or process which only the entity owning it can exercise.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The patent is as essential an item as machinery. Manufacturing is not possible without owning the patent. So the patent, although without physical substance, also deserves to be recognised as an asset just like the machinery. It is considered an intangible asset.</p>
</div>
<p>There are different modes of acquisition or generation of intangible assets. They are categorised as follows:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Separately acquired intangible assets</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Intangible assets acquired through:</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">a) </span>business combinations</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">b) </span>government grants</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">c) </span>exchange of assets</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Internally generated:</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Goodwill or</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Other intangible assets</p>
<p>The definition of an intangible asset given by the IAS also contains a reference to the feature of being &#x2018;without physical substance&#x2019;. In addition, the IAS specifies the following conditions to be satisfied by an item for it to be called an intangible asset:</p>
<p>These are discussed below:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>Identifiable :</span> this arises from <span class="bold">any one </span>of the following:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The intangible asset must be separable i.e. it should be capable of being separated from the entity, and sold / transferred. For example, import licences can be separated from the entity and sold.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>When the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights, regardless of whether the asset is separable and transferable or not.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Landing rights for aircraft were awarded by the government to Southern Airways, an aviation company. As per the terms of the agreement, these rights are not transferable. They are intangible assets even if they are not transferable.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2. </span>Control over the asset</span></p>
<p>This is normally indicated by:</p>
<p class="hang-a0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Power to obtain future economic benefits; <span class="bold">and </span></p>
<p class="hang-a0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Power to restrict the access of others to those benefits.</p>
<p>Thus power normally stems from a legal right e.g. copyright, but the legal right is not a necessary condition, because an entity may be able to control the future economic benefit in some other way.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Some <span class="bold">examples </span>where the control may or may not exist are discussed below:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Market and technical knowledge may be controlled by an entity if it has a legal right e.g. patents.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>Talent: an entity does not usually have the power over employees to<span class="bold"> force </span>them to stay with the entity. Therefore, <span class="bold">there is no &#x201C;control</span>&#x201D; and so the <span class="bold">employees do not meet the definition of an intangible asset.</span> However, take an example of a famous footballer. His skill will be considered an intangible asset as he is under a contract with a football club to play for 5 years.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>Portfolio of customers or market share: these may meet the criteria of control as evidenced through:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Legal rights i.e. contractual customer relationships; or</li>
<li>Regular transactions with the specific customers showing a customer relationship.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">3. </span>Existence of future economic benefits:</span> these may be seen by any one of the following ways:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>revenue from the sale of products or services;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>cost savings; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>other benefits resulting from the use of an asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Neon Co manufactures automobile components. It acquires an item with Japanese technical know-how. After the use of this technology in the production process, the cost of production is expected to be reduced in future. The technical expertise is an intangible asset.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Intangible assets can be of two types</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Acquired intangible assets</span></p>
<p>Acquired intangible assets are <span class="bold">acquired </span>from an outside entity e.g. an import licence which is purchased for $15,000.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Internally developed intangible assets</span></p>
<p>Certain assets may be internally developed by an entity using its own resources.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A pharmaceuticals company develops a drug formulation to treat patients infected with swine flu through in-house research and development. It consumes material, spends man days and uses assets to do the task. This is an internally developed intangible asset.</p>
</div>
<p>A most common example of internally generated intangible asset is Goodwill.</p>
<p>Goodwill refers to the good image of an entity in the minds of customers, because of which they keep on dealing with the entity. Many satisfied customers also recommend the entity to their relatives, friends and associates.</p>
<p>Goodwill is based on factors such as:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The reputation of a business for the high quality of its goods and services.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The work culture and personality of staff.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Cordial relationships with customers, reflected in prompt and helpful responses to their queries.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Distinction between goodwill and other intangible assets</span></p>
<p>Goodwill is a very valuable asset of an entity, but it normally lacks identifiably i.e. it is neither separable, nor does it arise from contractual or other legal rights. Other intangible assets may be identifiable.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Remember, other intangible assets e.g. licences and patents are separable from the entity i.e. they can be sold or transferred on their own. Goodwill, however, cannot be separated.</p>
</div>
<p>As discussed above, goodwill does not exist separately from the business. It can normally be acquired only with the business.</p>
<p>Unless goodwill is purchased, a reliable measurement of its cost may not be possible. As a result, goodwill is normally not recognised in the accounts unless it is purchased. A reliable measurement of the cost of other intangible assets is normally possible, whether they are acquired or internally generated.</p>
<p>In accordance with IFRS 3, when a business is acquired, goodwill represents a payment made by the acquirer in anticipation of future economic benefits from assets that are <span class="bold">not capable of being individually identified and separately recognised.</span></p>
<p>Goodwill is thus measured as the residual cost of the business combination after recognising all other assets and liabilities, including intangible assets. In fact, <span class="bold">IFRS 3 recommends that all possible intangible assets should be separately identified </span>and recognised <span class="bold">before </span>taking the value of <span class="bold">goodwill </span>as <span class="bold">a residual cost.</span></p>
<p>Separate identification of all possible intangible assets is essential since the considerations for recognition, measurement and impairment may be different for different kinds of intangible assets.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Beechcline Smithson (BS), pharmaceutical company was sold to a competitor Skipaxy. BS has many patents for medicines and also a number of projects which are being capitalised in expectation of potential future benefits.</p>
<p class="boxpara">To calculate the goodwill, BS will have to split out all its other intangible assets. The remaining difference between all the tangible and intangible assets after deducting all liabilities is goodwill.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. The criteria for the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Initial recognition</span></p>
<p>According to Para 21 of IAS 38 intangible assets as discussed in the earlier section, can be recognised <span class="bold">&#x201C;if and only if:</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Recognition conditions</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/112-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Measurement</span></p>
<p>After the recognition conditions as stated above are met, the next question is: at what value should the asset be recognised?</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">An intangible asset shall be <span class="bold">measured initially at cost.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The recognition and measurement process depends upon the mode of acquisition or generation of an asset.</span></p>
<p><img src="images/113-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. The subsequent accounting treatment, including the principle of impairment tests in relation to purchased goodwill.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 After initial recognition, an intangible asset should be valued by using either the cost model or the revaluation model.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. The cost model</span></p>
<p>According to Para 74 of IAS 38, after initial recognition, an intangible asset shall be carried at its cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A licence was purchased at $300,000 during 20X5. Annual amortisation of $30,000 was provided against the item during 20X6 and 20X7. At the end of 20X7, an impairment loss of $15,000 was determined.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Carrying value at end of 20X7 = $300,000 &#x2013; (2 x $30,000) &#x2013; $15,000 = $225,000</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. The revaluation model</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>After initial recognition, an intangible asset shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its <span class="bold">fair value </span>at the date of the revaluation less any <span class="bold">subsequent </span>accumulated amortisation and any subsequent accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span><span class="bold">Initial recognition </span>of the asset will be <span class="bold">at cost </span>only. Fair value is not to be used for the initial recognition.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span><span class="bold">Fair value</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">i. </span>This will be determined by reference to an <span class="bold">active market. </span>Items such as taxi licences and production quotas may have an active market.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Taxi cabs in New York have a concept of taxi &#x2018;medallions&#x2019;. You can operate a taxi-cab if you own a &#x2018;medallion&#x2019; a special item which you display in your taxi to prove you have the right to operate a cab.</p>
<p class="boxpara">So in New York there is an active market for the buying and selling of medallions, which sets the price.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>For many intangible assets, <span class="bold">an active market may not normally exist; </span>e.g. patents, copyrights, brands. For these, it is sensible to use the cost model rather than the revaluation model.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>If an intangible asset has been valued using the fair value model, all the other assets of its class shall be valued similarly, unless there is no active market for such assets.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">iv. </span>If no active market exists for an asset belonging to a class of revalued intangible assets, the asset may be valued using the cost model.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">v. </span>Revaluations shall be made with such regularity that the values carried in the statement of financial position do not differ materially from the fair values.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Subsequent measurement of intangible assets</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/114-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Selling an intangible asset which has been revalued</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The revaluation surplus relating to an intangible is transferred to retained earnings when it is <span class="bold">realised. </span>It is realised when the asset is disposed of (sold) or retired (no longer used).</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>For assets still in use, <span class="bold">part of the revaluation surplus can be transferred to retained earnings. </span>It is calculated as the difference between amortisation based on the historical cost and amortisation based on the revalued amount.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The transfer does not appear in the statement of profit or loss; it is done directly through equity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Useful life</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Useful life is:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the period over which an asset is expected to be available for use by an entity; or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the number of production or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by an entity.</p>
</div>
<p>The accounting of an intangible asset depends on its useful life, i.e. whether it is <span class="bold">finite or indefinite.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Finite useful life</span></p>
<p>Intangible assets that have a determinable life are classified under this head.</p>
<p>An intangible asset with a finite useful life <span class="bold">is amortised. </span>Amortisation means that a part of the asset value is transferred from the statement of financial position to the statement of profit or loss as a cost, in the same way as depreciation in the case of tangible assets.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sky Radios purchased a broadcasting licence on 1 January 20X6 for a period of 5 years through an auction process, for $2m. After 5 years, the process is likely to be repeated and the licence may go to the highest bidder.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The licence is an intangible asset that has a finite useful life. Sky Radios should recognise it as an asset, and amortise it over a period of 5 years.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Assuming that the economic benefits from the asset are expected to be received equally over the 5 years, a straight-line method shall be applied and $0.4m amortised each year.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="bold">amortised amount is allocated </span>on a systematic basis over its useful life. The useful life may be shorter than the legal or contractual life.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The legal life of a licence is 30 years, but the entity has acquired a right to use it for 10 years only. For amortisation, the entity will consider a period of 10 years only. The reason is that the asset is only being used by the entity for the next 10 years and there will be no future benefits after this date.</p>
</div>
<p>The amount to be amortised of intangible asset is the cost or other amount substituted for cost, less residual value.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">residual value </span>of an intangible asset is normally assumed to be zero unless:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>There is a <span class="bold">commitment by a third party to purchase </span>the asset at the end of its useful life; <span class="bold">or</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>There is an <span class="bold">active market which will probably exist at the end of its useful life,</span> and the residual value can be determined with reference to that market.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amortisation begins </span>when the asset is <span class="bold">ready for its intended use.</span> Amortisation stops when the asset is derecognised or when the asset is classified as held for sale, whichever happens earlier.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The method selected </span>should reflect the manner in which the future economic benefits of the asset are expected to be consumed. If that pattern cannot be determined reliably, the straight-line method should be used.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">In May 2014, The IASB has amended IAS 16, Property, plant and equipment and IAS 38, Intangible assets to clarify when a method of depreciation or amortisation based on revenue may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">In case of IAS 16 </span>- The amendment clarifies that for an item of property, plant and equipment revenue based depreciation method is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">In case of IAS 38 </span>- there is a rebuttable presumption that amortisation based on revenue is not appropriate. The presumption may only be rebutted in certain limited circumstances which include:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>where the intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue; or</li>
<li>where it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of the intangible asset are highly correlated.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The amortisation charge for the year <span class="bold">will normally be recognised in Profit or Loss.</span> If the intangible asset has been used to construct another asset, the amortisation may be capitalised.</p>
<p>The amortisation <span class="bold">period and method shall be reviewed </span>at least at the end of each financial year-end.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Amortisation is not stopped when the asset is not in use,</span> unless it has been fully amortised or classified as held for sale.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Impairment loss</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">impairment loss </span>is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Only if </span>there is an indication of impairment, the recoverable amount is compared with the carrying amount and impairment loss is recognised if necessary.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A licence to operate transport vehicles is acquired at a cost of $100,000, valid for 5 years. If everything goes well for the full period of 5 years, there is no need to check impairment, since there is no indication that the value of the licence may have been reduced.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, if it is known at the end of 2 years that the route on which the transport vehicle was running is no longer available for operating the vehicles, this is an indication that the value of the licence as an asset is doubtful.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The transport company has to check how much money it can get back from the government and compare this recoverable amount with the carrying amount of the licence.</p>
<p class="boxpara">If the recoverable amount is lower, the resulting impairment loss will be written off.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Indefinite useful life</span></p>
<p>If the useful life of an intangible asset cannot be determined, it is known as an asset with indefinite useful life.</p>
<p>An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life <span class="bold">is not amortised.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Impairment test: </span>In accordance with <span class="bold">IAS 36 Impairment of Assets,</span> an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life should be tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount with its carrying value.</p>
<p><span class="bold">This is to be done annually or when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Johnson Publishing Co owns a copyright purchased for $90,000. Its life is indefinite.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Johnson reviews impairment at each end of the reporting period. Between the ends of the reporting periods, if there is an indication that the copyright is impaired, Johnson checks it for impairment.</p>
</div>
<p>The useful life will be reviewed each period, to determine whether it is still appropriate to assess the asset&#x2019;s useful life as indefinite. If the assessment does not support the indefinite life of an intangible asset it shall be accounted for as change in accounting estimate in accordance with IAS 8.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 3: Amortisation of an intangible asset</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/117-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Retirements and disposals: Derecognition</span></p>
<p>Derecognition means <span class="bold">removing an asset from the statement of financial position</span></p>
<p>An intangible asset is <span class="bold">derecognised when:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>it is disposed of; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The gain or loss arising </span>from derecognition is determined as the difference between the net proceeds, if any, and the carrying amount of the asset.</p>
<p>The <span class="bold">gain or loss is recognised immediately </span>in the statement of profit or loss. The gain is <span class="bold">not classified as revenue, but shown as other income.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.4 Goodwill and its impairment</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Amortisation of goodwill,</span> (previously allowed under earlier accounting standards), is not permitted by IFRS 3. After initial measurement, the acquirer measures goodwill at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. A test of impairment should be conducted annually or more frequently if events and changes in the circumstances indicate that it might have been impaired.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.5 Research and development</span><a href="videos/IAS38 Intangible Assets Part 2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>People are always on a lookout for a new and more efficient way of doing things, i.e. whether in a better manner or at a lower cost or both. This requires research and development (universally abbreviated to &#x2018;R&amp;D&#x2019;), and business entities routinely spend money on such activities.</p>
<p>For industries such as pharmaceuticals, R&amp;D is an essential activity. They not only look for better ways of doing the things, but also try to develop new medicines which never existed before. These companies spend large amounts on R&amp;D.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">R&amp;D expenditure incurred to develop medicines for curing cancer.</p>
</div>
<p>What would happen if there were no guidelines to recognise the intangible assets developed out of the R&amp;D process? Companies would build up an intangible asset which does not have a substance and does not meet the definition of an asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company spent $5m on the R&amp;D related to cancer. The product developed did not work, but the company still capitalised the expense and recognised an intangible asset.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This asset is a fictitious asset, which should not be capitalised.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.6 Conditions for IAS 38 Intangible Assets</span></p>
<p>In view of the risks mentioned above, it is necessary to lay down strict conditions to be satisfied before the assets generated by R&amp;D are recognised.</p>
<p>IAS 38 Intangible Assets lays down the required definitions of research and development: </p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Research </span>is original and planned investigation undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Development </span>is the <span class="bold">application of research findings or other knowledge </span>to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services <span class="bold">before the start of commercial production or use.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The activity related to internal generation of an intangible asset is divided between the research phase and the development phase.<span class="bold"> If an entity finds it difficult to distinguish between the activities, then the entire expenditure is treated as being on the research phase.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.7 Expenditure on the research phase</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Research means trying out different possibilities and checking their outcomes. It has an element of trial and error. People expect a particular outcome but are <span class="bold">not certain </span>about it. Examples of research expenditure are activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge, and the search for new materials, devices, products and processes.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Expenditure on research should be recognised as an expense and not as an intangible asset. The reason is that, normally, at this stage an entity cannot demonstrate that an asset exists and that future economic benefits will flow from it. The expenditure therefore does not satisfy the definition of an asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Examples of research activities are:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>activities aimed at obtaining new knowledge;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>the search for, evaluation and final selection of, applications of research findings or other knowledge;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>the search for alternatives for materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services; and</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iv. </span>the formulation, design, evaluation and final selection of possible alternatives for new or improved materials, devices, products, processes, systems or services.</p>
</div>

<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Jontex Pharmaceuticals undertook a project to develop a cheaper but more effective drug to fight the malaria. It employed a team of scientists to obtain new knowledge, materials and processes. The team tried different alternatives, many of which failed. <span class="bold">This is a research phase. The expenditure of $1.77m on this phase is written off.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The company later arrived at a unique proven formula. It narrowed down on certain materials and processes. It decided to test the formula on a wider scale and obtain patents and licences worldwide.</p>
<p class="boxpara">It is confident that it has the resources to complete the project and exploit it commercially, and that the improved cost-effective formula will generate substantial sales. The recognition criteria are met. This is a development phase.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Expenditure on this phase amounted to $2.5m. <span class="bold">Jontex can capitalise the expenditure and recognise an intangible asset because it meets the criteria laid down by IAS 38, i.e.:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>It is now technically feasible to complete the asset.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Management has demonstrated its intention to complete the asset and use it.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The company has the ability to use the new formula and produce the drug.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>Future sales of the drug will bring economic benefits.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb-n">5. </span>The company has the resources to complete the development and use the asset.<br/>
It has an accounts department that will measure and record the expenditure during the development of the asset.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.9 Internally generated brands, mastheads, publishing titles, customer lists and items similar in substance shall not be recognised as intangible assets. </span>The reason is that expenditure on these items cannot be distinguished from the cost of developing the business as a whole.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.10 Cost of an internally generated intangible asset</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The cost is the sum of expenditure incurred <span class="bold">from the date when the intangible asset first meets the recognition criteria.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>All directly attributable costs are added e.g. costs of materials and services, professional fees, employee costs, amortisation of patents and licences used to generate an asset.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>IAS 38 <span class="bold">prohibits reinstatement of expenditure </span>previously recognised as expenses.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing the previous example of Jontex</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Once the project meets the recognition criteria, the company can start to capitalise the costs as an intangible asset. However, it cannot reinstate as an asset the research expenditure incurred in the earlier stage and expensed. Therefore it can recognise only $2.5m as an intangible asset. It cannot reinstate the earlier expenditure of $1.77m.</p>

<p></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">7. </span>A building had a revaluation surplus of $0.5 million associated with it. It was then sold. The accountant wants to transfer the revaluation surplus to retained earnings through the statement of profit or loss. Please advice.</p>
<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>These are all intangible assets because they are all identifiable non&#x2013;monetary assets without physical substance. Similarly; these assets are likely to bring future economic benefits.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Yes, because it lacks features essential to make an asset identifiable i.e. it is not separable; similarly, it does not arise from a contractual or legal rights.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>No, because it does not satisfy the requirement of identifiablity. Its reliable measurement is also not possible.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>No, its initial measurement has to be at cost, as required by IAS 38.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span>False. Amortisation does not depend upon the model of accounting chosen. If an asset has a finite useful life, its cost shall be amortised over its useful life, whichever model is used.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">6. </span>No, assets with a finite useful life are not tested for impairment, unless there is an indication of impairment. Those with an indefinite useful life are tested for impairment each period.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">7. </span>Since the asset is sold, the accountant can transfer the revaluation surplus to retained earnings. However, according to the provisions of IAS 38, he cannot route the transfer through the statement of profit or loss.</p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>If an entity has the power to obtain future economic benefits and the power to restrict the access of others to these benefits, this indicates that the entity has control over the assets. While an entity may have physical possession or may have legal right to the asset, the future economic benefits may not be enjoyed by the entity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>In order to recognise development expenditure as an asset, the company should demonstrate all the points given in D.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>All the expenditure incurred at the research phase should be recognised as expenditure and not as an asset. An asset can be recognised only when the resources are controlled by the company and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the company. Here, the economic benefits are expected to flow as the company is anticipating a high demand for the medicine.</p>
<p>In (i) and (ii), the asset is not generated and it is clear that until this stage no future economic benefit will flow to the company, therefore the amount should not be treated as an asset. At the research stage an entity cannot demonstrate that the asset exists and future economic benefits will flow from the asset.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>When an intangible asset has an indefinite useful life, impairment is done only if there is an indication of it.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>Capitalised expenditure:<br/>
= $70 million - $7 million depreciation (10% x $70 million)<br/>
= $63 million</p>
