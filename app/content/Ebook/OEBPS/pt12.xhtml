<p>In today&#x2019;s economy, transactions spanning the world involving foreign currencies have become the rule rather than the exception. Hence a modern accountant needs to understand how foreign exchange transactions are recorded and presented in the financial statements.</p>
<p>Imagine that Corex Co, based in the UK bought a machine made in India by Index Co on 23 January 20X6. The machine was priced at Rs.200,000 where the exchange rate of &#x00A3; to Rs is 1:100.Corex Co would show the machine as having been purchased for 200,000/100 = &#x00A3;2,000.</p>
<p>However, Corex has 3 months credit from Index Co, so will not pay until 23 April 20X6. Now imagine that on 23 April 20X6, when Corex is to pay, the rate has changed to 1:120.Corex will actually have to pay 200,000/120 = &#x00A3;1,666, instead of &#x00A3;2,000. The question is, how is this all recorded in the financial statements?</p>
<p>This Study Guide which is based on IAS 21&#x2019;The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates&#x2019; takes you through all the concepts and principles which you need to master to ensure compliance with IAS 21 while recording foreign exchange transactions.</p>
