<p>The date on which an entity determines and reports its financial position is known as the end of the reporting period. This date is very crucial for every entity. The events occurring up to the end of the reporting period affect the financial results of the company, thus inclusion of these events is very important in order to ascertain the financial position.</p>
<p>Sometimes, events occurring after the end of the reporting period provide additional information of the events occurred before the end of the reporting period such that it may affect the financial results of the entity.</p>
<p>IAS 10, Events after the reporting period, provides guidance on accounting and disclosure of events after reporting period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Events after the reporting period </span>are those events, favourable and unfavourable, that occur between the end of reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue.</p>
</div>
<p>Following are a few examples of events occurring after the reporting period:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Theft of plant and equipment</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Amalgamation of companies</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Resignation of the CEO of the company</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>Closure of one of the manufacturing facilities</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span>Significant purchase of shares of other companies</p>
<p>The conditions for <span class="bold">events after the end of reporting period </span>to apply are:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The event may be either <span class="bold">favourable </span>or <span class="bold">unfavourable (i.e. good or bad for the company)</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The event <span class="bold">arises after the end of reporting period</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The event occurs between the <span class="bold">end of reporting period </span>and the <span class="bold">date of authorisation of financial statements for issue</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Events arising after the end of reporting period</span></p>
<p>Financial statements are prepared up to the end of the financial year e.g. for the year to 31 December 2008. However, the <span class="bold">process of preparation of the statements takes some time </span>e.g. the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2008 could be finalised on 28 February 2009.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some events may take place that have a bearing on the financial statements. The question that arises is whether the financial statements need to be <span class="bold">changed </span>as a result of these events occurring after the end of reporting period but before the statements are authorised for issue.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Events after end of the reporting period</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/290-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Events after the reporting period</span></p>
<p>IAS 10 distinguishes two types of events after the reporting period:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Adjusting events</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Non-adjusting events</p>
<p><span class="bold">1. Adjusting events</span></p>
<p>&#x2018;Adjusting events&#x2019; are events after the reporting period that <span class="bold">necessitates </span>adjustments to the figures in the financial statements. They provide evidence of conditions that <span class="bold">existed at the end of reporting period. </span>An entity simply <span class="bold">adjusts the amounts originally recognised in its financial statements </span>in order to reflect the effect of &#x2018;adjusting events after the reporting period&#x2019;.</p>
<p>IAS 10 lists the following instances of adjusting events:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The <span class="bold">settlement of a court case </span>after the reporting period confirms that the entity had a present obligation at the end of reporting period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A case for damages against Dolcart Co was pending in court on 31 March 2009, the end of reporting period. Dolcart had estimated the likely liability at $100,000 and made a provision in the accounts.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The court gave a verdict on 31 May 2009, fixing the liability at $125,000. Dolcart accepted the verdict. The financial statements were authorised for issue on 30 June 2009.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This is an adjusting event because on 31 May 2009:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>it confirms the obligation that the company had at the end of reporting period and</li>
<li>the financial statements have not yet been authorised for issue (the financial statements are authorised for issue on 30 June 2009)</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">The company has to increase the provision made from $100,000 to $125,000. (Dr Expense and Cr Provision).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Events indicating that:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>an asset was impaired at the end of reporting period, or</li>
<li>the amount of a previously recognised impairment loss for that asset needs to be adjusted.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>The determination after the reporting period of the cost of assets purchased, or the proceeds from assets sold, before the end of reporting period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Mule Co purchased a used machine from Jule Co on 30 November 2009 and started using it. The purchase consideration was agreed tentatively at $130,000, subject to verification by a professional valuer.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The machine was recorded at this value at the end of reporting period which was 31 December 2009. The valuer submitted the final valuation report on 28 February 2010, and stated that the value of the machine was $115,000. The financial statements were authorised for issue on 31 March 2010.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">This is an adjusting event </span>because on 28 February 2010:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Mule Co determines the exact cost of the asset at the end of reporting period; and</li>
<li>The financial statements have not yet been authorised for issue (financial statements are authorised for issue on 31 March 2010.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore Mule Co has to decrease the cost of machine to $115,000 from $130,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">d) </span>The discovery of fraud or errors that show that the financial statements are incorrect.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">While auditing the financial statements for the year 2009, a fraud was unveiled that involved a cash embezzlement of $20,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This, being an adjusting event, should be recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Detection of fraud</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">While auditing the financial statements of Roma Foods for 2009, on 18 February 2010, the auditors of the company detected fictitious sales invoices totalling $123,000. This is evidence of error / fraud at the end of reporting period. Therefore in the financial statements as at 31 December 2009, sales will be adjusted, i.e. sales will be reduced by $123,000.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Adjusting event: going concern assumption</span></p>
<p>Sometimes events after the reporting period indicate that the going concern assumption is no longer valid. The going concern assumption means that the entity is likely to continue in a similar capacity for the foreseeable future. The basis of measurement of assets is based on this assumption.</p>
<p>If management of any company decides to close the unit, and the effect is so pervasive that going concern assumption is not appropriate IAS 10<span class="bold"> requires </span>a fundamental change in the basis of accounting <span class="bold">rather than </span>just an adjustment to the values recognised within the original basis of accounting</p>
<p>When the company is considered to be a going concern the financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis. If the company is not considered a going concern the financial statements are prepared on a break-up basis.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Equipment with a book value of $75,000 (cost less depreciation) is retained at the value under the cost model while the entity is a going concern.</p>
<p class="boxpara">When it ceases to be a going concern, the entity will have to value the asset at the lower of its carrying amount and the realisable value, which is likely to be well under $75,000.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p><span class="bold">Adjusting events </span>occur after the reporting period and affect the financial position of the entity at the end of reporting period. Hence they <span class="bold">warrant an adjustment </span>in the financial statements.</p>
</div>
<p>An entity needs to disclose adjusting events in its financial statements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Non-adjusting events</span></p>
<p>Non-adjusting events are:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Events that <span class="bold">occur after the reporting period.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>These conditions normally <span class="bold">do not affect the valuation of assets / liabilities </span>in the financial statements as at the end of reporting period.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>These events would only be <span class="bold">disclosed by way of notes in the financial statements only if </span>they are of such importance that non-disclosure would affect the ability of users to make proper evaluations and decisions i.e. if they are material.<span class="bold"> They need not be adjusted </span>in the financial statements. The <span class="bold">financial statements </span>remain <span class="bold">unaltered.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rico Ltd had investments worth $35 million as at 31 December 2009. On 13 January 2010, there was a huge crash in the stock prices due to a scam which came to light and the value of the investments fell to $5 million. This is an event which occurs after the end of reporting period, but does not change the value as at the end of reporting period. Hence, this is a non-adjusting event.</p>
</div>
<p>The example above relates to investments only (as mentioned specifically by IAS 10). Other assets will normally be subject to the rule of being valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value is often ascertained after the year end.</p>
<p>Therefore, non-adjusting events are those events which do not affect the financial position at the end of reporting period, but which still need disclosure in some way so as to prevent users of financial statements from being misled.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sunsand Group sold its Malaysia hotel to Ritz in January 2009. This is an event after the reporting period, but it does not affect the valuation of assets / liabilities in the financial statements as at the end of reporting period. However, it is a significant event hence it would be required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements of Sunsand Group for 2008.</p>
</div>
<p>Additional examples of significant non-adjusting events are as follows:</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>According to IAS 10, if an entity proposes or declares dividends to shareholders after the reporting period, the entity shall not record those dividends as a liability in the financial statements. However, if dividends are proposed and declared after the reporting period, but before the financial statements are approved for issue, the dividends are to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>A major business combination or disposal of a subsidiary.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>Major purchases and disposals of assets.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">iv. </span>Destruction of a production facility by fire after the reporting period.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">v. </span>Announcement of a plan to discontinue an operation.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">vi. </span>Announcement or commencement of implementation of a major restructuring and</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">vii. </span>Major litigation arising from events occurring after the reporting period.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Disclosures for non-adjusting events after the end of reporting period</span></p>
<p>Non-adjusting events do not affect the valuation of an entity&#x2019;s assets / liabilities at the end of the reporting period, but their disclosure is required if non-disclosure would affect the ability of users to make proper evaluations and decisions in the notes to financial statements.</p>
<p>If non-adjusting events are material, non-disclosure could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.</p>
<p>According to Para 21 of IAS 10, an entity shall <span class="bold">disclose </span>the following for each <span class="bold">material category of non-adjusting events after the end of reporting period:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the <span class="bold">nature </span>of the event.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>an <span class="bold">estimate of its financial effect </span>or a statement that such an estimate cannot be made.</p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>Events after the reporting period are the events that occur between the end of the reporting period and the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue. Even if profit and other selected information is announced before the date when the financial statements are authorised for issue, the date of issue should be considered for determining the events after the reporting period.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>Decline in the market value of a long-term investment is a non-adjusting event, since the market value is affected by conditions after the reporting period and not by conditions at the end of the reporting period. All other events need adjustment.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>The events that provide evidence of the conditions existing at the end of the reporting period need to be adjusted.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Fire does not affect the value of the factory at the end of the reporting period. However it will be <span class="bold">disclosed </span>in the notes to account as knowledge of this fact is of interest to the shareholders.</li>
<li>Sale of inventory at less than the cost after the reporting date gives an indication about the value of inventories at the reporting date. Hence it is an adjusting event.</li>
<li>Bankruptcy of the customer explains that recovery of the customer&#x2019;s balance at the end of the reporting period was <span class="bold">doubtful. </span>Hence it is an adjusting event.</li>
<li>Issue of ordinary shares need not be adjusted as it is <span class="bold">not related to the ordinary share capital </span>at the end of the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>Following events require disclosure in the financial statements:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(a) </span>Major business combinations after the reporting period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(b) </span>Major purchases of assets, other disposals of assets or expropriation of major assets by government</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(c) </span>Commencing major litigations arising solely out of events that occurred after the reporting period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(d) </span>Disposal of a major subsidiary or discontinuation of any business operation</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>IAS 10 requires that if the going concern assumption is no longer valid, mere adjustment in the financial statements is not sufficient but a fundamental change in the basis of accounting is needed.</p>
