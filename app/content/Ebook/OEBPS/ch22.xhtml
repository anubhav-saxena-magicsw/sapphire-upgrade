<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Define an operating segment.</span></p>
<p>The International Accounting Standards Board <span class="bold">issued IFRS 8 Operating segments,</span> <span class="bold">on 30 November 2006. </span>It <span class="bold">replaces IAS 14,</span> segment reporting. IFRS 8 is <span class="bold">mandatory </span>for annual financial statements for periods beginning on or after <span class="bold">1 January 2009,</span> although earlier application is permitted.</p>
<p>The term operating segment has been defined in IFRS 8 as follows:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">operating segment </span>is a component of an entity:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>that <span class="bold">engages in business activities </span>from which it <span class="bold">may earn revenues and incur expenses </span>(including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);</li>
<li>whose <span class="bold">operating results </span>are <span class="bold">reviewed </span>regularly by the entity&#x2019;s <span class="bold">chief operating decision maker </span>to make <span class="bold">decisions about resources </span>to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and</li>
<li>for which discrete <span class="bold">financial information </span>is available.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Operating segments</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/318-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Real InfoTech is a company engaged in various activities related to information technology.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The major operations comprise:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Software segment</li>
<li>Business service segment</li>
<li>Hardware product segment</li>
<li>Financing segment</li>
<li>Technology service segment</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">Financial information regarding revenue, profit / loss, assets and liabilities are available for each of the segments mentioned above. These segments represent the various components of the company. <span class="bold">Financial information </span>for the various operations<span class="bold"> is available to the company. </span>The <span class="bold">financial information is reviewed regularly by the key management personnel (KMP). </span>The <span class="bold">financial information is used to decide the allocation of the company&#x2019;s resources. Hence the segment information mentioned above meets the requirements of operating segments.</span></p>
</div>
<p>According to the IFRS 8, <span class="bold">operating segments may include segments for which the entity has still to earn revenue.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Electronics Ltd manufactures and markets electronic items. It has recently entered into the internet business. This segment has not started generating revenue as at the reporting date. However, the company wishes to highlight it as a start-up activity that incurs cost but does not generate revenue. Therefore the segment is treated as an operating segment.</p>
</div>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Identify reportable segments (including applying the aggregation criteria and quantitative thresholds).</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Determination of reportable segment</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">1. </span>According to the IFRS, reportable segments are determined as follows:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">operating segment </span>is a component of an entity:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>that <span class="bold">engages in business activities </span>from which it <span class="bold">may earn revenues and incur expenses </span>(including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with other components of the same entity);</li>
<li>whose <span class="bold">operating results </span>are <span class="bold">reviewed </span>regularly by the entity&#x2019;s <span class="bold">chief operating decision maker </span>to make <span class="bold">decisions about resources </span>to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance; and</li>
<li>for which discrete financial information is available.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In order to establish whether a segment is a reportable segment, the standard suggests using either a quantitative threshold (as explained in paragraph 2 below) or basing the segment split on the aggregation criteria (as explained in paragraph 3 below).</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Quantitative threshold (QT)</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Segments must be reported on separately if they meet any of these criteria:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Reported revenues (internal and external) are more than 10% of the combined revenues (internal and external) of all the segments.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>The absolute amount of its reported profit or loss is 10% or more of the greater, in absolute amount, of</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> the combined reported profit of all the operating segments that did not report a loss, and</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> the combined reported loss of all the operating segments that reported a loss.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>Assets are more than 10% of the combined assets of all the segments.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Saturn Ltd has identified the following segments: (All amounts in $ &#x2018;000)</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/319-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Using the quantitative threshold mentioned above, reportable segments can be identified as follows:</p>
<table class="table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="bold">Step 1</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">Calculate which segments are reportable based on 10% of revenue</span><br/>
Segments iron, steel, aluminium, copper and limestone have revenue from sales to external customers and from transactions with other segments of more than 10% of the total revenue (external and internal), of all segments (W1)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span class="bold">Step 2</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">Calculate which segments are reportable based on 10% of combined profit / loss</span><br/>
Segments iron, cement, copper and limestone have segment results, whether profit or loss, at 10% or more of the combined profit of all segments in profit or the combined loss of all segments in loss, whichever is the greater in absolute amount</td>

<td><span class="bold">Step 3</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">Calculate which segments are reportable based on 10% of total assets</span><br/>
Segments iron, cement and copper have assets which are 10% or more of the total assets of all segments</td>

<p class="boxpara">Therefore segments iron; cement, steel, aluminium, copper and limestone are the reportable segments.</p>
</div>

<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Workings (All amounts in $ &#x2018;000)</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/320-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Alternative method</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">There is another alternative available for performing above calculations to identify reportable segments. Here instead of calculating percentages for each segment, a quantitative threshold (i.e. 10% of total) is calculated. Then actual figures are compared with the threshold calculated to identify reporting segments.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Using the quantitative threshold mentioned above, reportable segments can be identified as follows:</p>
<table class="table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span class="bold">Step&#x00A0;1</span></td>

<tr>
<td><span class="bold">Step 2</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">Calculate which segments are reportable based on 10% of combined profit / loss</span><br/>The threshold is 3.9.

<td><span class="bold">Step 3</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">Calculate which segments are reportable based on 10% of total assets</span><br/>
The asset threshold is 19.6. Segments Iron, Cement and Copper have assets which are 10% or more of the total assets of all segments (W5)</td>

<p><span class="bold">Aggregation criteria</span></p>
<p>Operating segments may be combined if they have similar:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Economic characteristics</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment if aggregation is consistent with the core principle of this IFRS, the segments have similar economic characteristics and the segments are similar in each of the following respects:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the nature of the products and services;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the nature of the production processes;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>the type or class of customer for their products and services;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">e) </span>if applicable, the nature of the regulatory environment, for example, banking, insurance or public utilities</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sepsi Co markets the following products:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/321-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">The above information shows that the gross profit margin is similar for the products which come under aerated drinks. Hence the aggregation criteria can be applied and the products under aerated drinks i.e. Pride, Lime Punch and Orange can be merged as one reportable entity since they have similar economic characteristics.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Production processes</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Manfa Furniture manufactures and sells furniture. The main products it manufactures are chairs, tables and sofas.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The production process is similar for chairs and tables. Hence the aggregation criteria can be applied and the products chairs and tables can be aggregated and reported as an operating segment.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Santa Banks provides the following services: corporate banking, retail banking, personal banking, and commercial banking and cash management services. Its major customers for corporate banking and cash management services are corporate bodies. Therefore the entity can merge corporate banking services and commercial banking services and treat them as one reporting segment using the aggregation criteria.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Distribution methods; and</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Raison Publishers carry out the following two major activities: Publishing of books, both academic and educational and e-learning. The distribution methods for the books section are quite similar for all the books that are published. Therefore, applying the aggregation criteria, the publishing activities of the both types of books can be merged and reported as a single reporting segment.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Regulatory environments</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Beeline Services is involved in various business activities which include insurance and share broking. Under insurance, it provides insurance of life and property. Its insurance activities are regulated by the Insurance Act. So all the services under the insurance business may be aggregated and the merged segment may be reported as a single segment.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The criteria for applying the aggregation criteria</span></p>
<p>If there are more operating segments than can be reported on usefully, then some segments may be aggregated.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Quality insurance provides insurance services in Germany, France, Scotland, India, China, Japan and USA.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Segments Germany, France, India and China meet the threshold limits. So information about these segments has to be given in separate columns in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However segments Scotland, China Japan and USA do not meet the threshold limits. Hence information about these segments can be aggregated (provided they fulfil the other criteria for aggregation explained below).</p>
</div>
<p>The procedure is as follows:</p>
<p>Segments that do not individually exceed the 10% threshold limit, may be aggregated</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>if the operating segments have similar economic characteristics; and</li>
<li>share a majority of the features of the aggregation criteria mentioned above (i.e. have similar production processes, customers, distribution systems and regulatory authority).</li>
<li>If the total external revenue reported by operating segments is less than 75% of the entity&#x2019;s revenue, then a lower threshold than 10% is applied in order to identify additional operating segments until at least 75% of the entity&#x2019;s revenue is reported.</li>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>Segments of heavy, light and commercial vehicles are reportable because the total revenue of each is greater than 10% of total revenue i.e. external and internal revenue. Also, as these segments generate 75% of external revenue [((105+42+15) as % of 216)], no additional segment needs to be reported.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>Entities which generate revenue from any single customer amounting to more than 10% of the entity&#x2019;s revenue need to disclose certain details. The disclosure is to be made about the total amount of revenue from each such customer and the identity of the segment reporting the revenue. However, the identity of the major customer need not be disclosed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An enterprise shall disclose general information, including factors used to identify reportable segments and the types of products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues. Further it shall disclose certain information about reported segment profit and loss, assets, and basis of measurement.</li>
<li>IFRS 8 does not require disclosures about the term chief operating decision maker and specifically states that this term identifies a function, not necessarily a manager with a specific title.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>IFRS 8 on segment reporting includes guidance in this regards. The three tests required include a revenue test, profit or loss test, and an asset test.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Earning revenue is not a precondition to recognise any segment as an operating segment. It can be taken as an operating segment even if the segment has not earned any revenue till the end of the reporting period.</p>
