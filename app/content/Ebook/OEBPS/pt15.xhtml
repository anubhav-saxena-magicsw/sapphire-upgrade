<p>Imagine that you work for a mining company and you are involved in finding suitable land, assessing whether it has mineral reserves and conducting a survey to assess the quality of the reserves. There may be occasions when your company has bought land, spent a considerable amount on testing the land, only to find out that its mineral content is extremely low. In these cases, would it make sense, under IFRS, to capitalise all the expenses? If so, at which point would you start capitalising? When would you stop?</p>
<p>The purpose of this Study Guide is to help you understand when and how to capitalise exploration and evaluation expenditures. The figures involved are often very large and so it makes sense for you to understand and be able to apply IFRS 6!</p>
