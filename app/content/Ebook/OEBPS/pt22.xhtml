<p>In today&#x2019;s global economy, most entities produce and market a variety of products and services and also operate in many geographical areas of the world. Each of the products and geographical areas are naturally subject to different rates of profitability, risks, and opportunities and so on. It is therefore essential for key management personnel to be aware of the risks and returns involved in each geographical area and for each product / service. This information will enable key management personnel to make appropriate decisions regarding the utilisation of the entity&#x2019;s resources.</p>
<p>IFRS 8 deals with providing segment information. The objective of the IFRS is to establish principles for reporting financial information by segment. That is, information regarding the different types of products and services an entity produces and the different geographical areas in which it operates. This information will enable users of financial statements to:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>understand the entity&#x2019;s past performance better</li>
<li>assess the entity&#x2019;s risks and returns better</li>
<li>make more informed judgements about the entity as a whole</li>
</ul>
<p>E.g. The GE Group has the following businesses:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>GE commercial finance</li>
<li>GE Healthcare</li>
<li>GE Industrial</li>
<li>GE Money</li>
<li>GE infrastructure</li>
<li>NBC Universal</li>
</ul>
<p>For each of the operations, the risk and returns will be different. Therefore, preparation of the financial statements in accordance with the IFRS will enable the group to determine the amount of resources to be utilised for each of the services; so that optimum return on investment can be ensured.</p>
<p>This Study Guide explains the concepts relating to operating segments. Studying this Study Guide will enable you to prepare financial statements in accordance with the IFRS in your professional assignments.</p>
