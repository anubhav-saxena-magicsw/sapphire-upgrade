<p>The SOFP and SOPL are prepared under the rules of accrual accounting. The concept of accrual however does not show the actual movement of cash into and out of the company. For example, credit sale and credit purchases are accounted for by the accrual system of accounting. However, the users of financial statements also need information on the liquidity of the entity, as there needs to be sufficient cash to pay the liabilities as they become due.</p>
<p>The statement of cash flows shows the movement of cash under three distinct sections of the cash flow cycle and allows users to assess the cash flows and their sources.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Cash flow from operating activity</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Cash flow from investing activity</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Cash flow from financing activity</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Cash flows from operating activities</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Operating activities </span>are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity and other activities that are not investing or financing activities.</p>
</div>
<p>The disclosure of the cash flows from operating activities will enable users to judge whether the entity is fulfilling the main purpose for which it exists, i.e. to earn sufficient money from the principal revenue-producing activities so as to maintain operating capability, pay dividends, repay loans and make new investments.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Blue Ltd&#x2019;s statement of cash flows shows that it earns cash worth $25m from operations. It pays dividends of $15m, repays a loan worth $22m, takes out a new loan of $13m, and makes new investments of $1m. Information in its financial statements shows that the repayment of $22m is towards normal loan instalments due. The statement of cash flows shows that Blue Ltd is not earning sufficient cash from operations. It has to use the money from a fresh borrowing to repay the earlier loan.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Generally, cash receipts or payments for all items in the SOPL will be included in calculating cash flows from operating activities.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Cash flows from operating activities, as given in the IAS, are as follows:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>cash payments to suppliers for goods and services</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>cash payments to and on behalf of employees</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">e) </span>cash payments or refunds of income taxes</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Some transactions e.g. sale of non-current assets may be partially reflected in the SOPL to the extent of the profit or loss on sale of a non-current asset. However, cash flows resulting from such transactions should not be classified under operating activities but should be taken to an appropriate activity group &#x2013; in this case, investing activities.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A building with a carrying value of $3m is sold for $5m. The statement of financial position will show $3m as a reduction from the building value and the SOPL will show $2m as profit on sale of the building. So far as the statement of cash flows is concerned, the entire amount of $5m is shown as a cash inflow from investing activities. The $2m profit on sale will be shown as an adjustment when calculating cash flows from operating activities.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>If securities and loans are held for trading purposes, cash flows from them are classified as being from operating activities, because they are similar to inventory acquired specifically for sale.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Government securities worth $45m, which were held for trading purposes, are sold for $46m. This will be reflected as a cash flow from operating activities and not from investing activities.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Direct / indirect methods</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity should report cash flows from <span class="bold">operating activities </span>using either of the following:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The <span class="bold">direct method,</span> whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments are disclosed; Or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The <span class="bold">indirect method,</span> whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of transactions of a non-cash nature, any deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments, and items of income or expense associated with investing or financing cash flows.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Direct method &#x2013; gross receipts and payments</span></p>
<p>The standard recommends this method, because it provides information which may be useful in estimating future cash flows.</p>
<p>The information under major classes of gross receipts and payments of cash may be obtained either</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>directly from the accounting records; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>taking the SOPL as the basis and adjusting the figures for sales, cost of sales and other items for</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;</li>
<li>other non-cash items; and</li>
<li>other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash.</li>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sales in the SOPL are $25m and the increase in the receivables is $2m (opening balance = $3m, closing = $5m). What is the figure for amounts collected from receivables?</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/330-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, the balance of receivables brought forward was $3m. Additional sales (assumed to be credit sales) were $25m. This makes total receivables of $28m. However, at year end, $5m out of this was outstanding; thus 28 &#x2013; 5 = $23m was received from customers.</p>
<p class="boxpara">We can make a simplified rule from the above- if receivables increase, more money is tied up in receivables and less cash is received. Therefore an increase in receivables (or inventory) causes a reduction in the inflow from operating activities. By the same logic, a decrease in these assets will increase the inflow.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The opening balance on trade payables was $2m. The closing balance was $1m. If purchases during the year were $18m, what was the actual amount paid to suppliers?</p>

<p><span class="bold">Indirect method</span><a href="videos/Statement of Cash Flow_Part2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>This method is easier, faster, cheaper and therefore preferred by many companies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">1. Net profit</span></p>
<p>The net profit or loss from the statement of profit or loss is taken as a starting figure, and adjustments are made for the effects of the following items.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Non-cash items</span></p>
<p>Items such as depreciation, provisions and deferred taxes may appear in the statement of profit or loss but do not represent cash flow. The net profit / loss taken as the starting figure include the effect of all of these. Hence we need to eliminate them.</p>
<p>Take the case of depreciation. The asset on which depreciation is charged was purchased in the past. When we disclose depreciation as an expense in the statement of profit or loss, we charge an expense for which there is no cash flow.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Game Ltd&#x2019;s statement of profit or loss shows a net profit of $75m after charging depreciation of $8m and recognising a $4m exchange gain on translation of a foreign operation.</p>

<p><span class="bold">3. Separate the investing and financing components</span></p>
<p>Net profit will include the effects of gains or losses on account of investing and financing activities. Remember, investing activities are shown separately, so we need to remove these items from operating activities. We do this by adjusting net profit.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Net cash profit of Large Company is $7m after a profit of $0.6 m on the disposal of machine with a carrying value of $1m.

<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Investing activities </span>are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in cash equivalents.</p>
</div>
<p>This group of activities indicates the extent to which the entity is investing in the activities which will bring benefits in the future.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">If money is invested in a new machinery, it will help the entity to produce and sell goods, and thus to generate income in the future.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Financing activities </span>are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity and borrowings of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>This includes the following cash receipts and payments:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Issue or redemption of shares.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Borrowing and repayment of debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages and other short- or long-term borrowings.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Cash payments towards the principal portion by the lessee of a financial lease.</p>
<p>The information under this group of activities helps the readers to know how the entity has raised or repaid financial resources. These details help in predicting claims on future cash flows by providers of capital to the entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Ingrip Plc raised $500,000 by an issue of shares and $200,000 by way of term loans from banks. It invested $400,000 in a building and $300,000 in plant and equipment. Raising money by the way of an issue of shares or bank loans is a financing activity and shown as a cash inflow under this category. Therefore $500,000 + $200,000 = $700,000 as cash flow from financing activity.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Similarly, investing money in buildings and plant and equipment is an investing activity and is disclosed as a cash outflow under this category.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Classification of certain specific items</span></p>
<p>IAS 7 gives guidance on the classification of certain items. Consider the following example to understand the impact of each classification:</p>
<p><span class="bold">1. Classification of interest paid and interest and dividends received</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>For financial institutions, interest paid and interest and dividends received are usually classified as operating cash flows. The reason is that accepting deposits, lending / investing money and paying interest and receiving interest or dividends are operating activities for financial institutions.</li>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>False because cash includes cash on hand and demand deposits.<br/>
Cash equivalents are short-term cash commitments that are readily convertible into cash and there should be no significant risks of change in the value to be realised. On the other hand, net working capital is excess of current assets over current liabilities.</p>
