<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. Determine an entity&#x2019;s functional currency.</span></p>
<p>IAS 21 requires each entity to determine its functional currency.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Functional currency </span>is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 </span>The <span class="bold">primary economic environment (PEcoE) </span>in which an entity operates</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: The primary economic environment in which an entity operates</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p214-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Factors which determine the functional currency of the entity</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p214-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>These factors are explained below:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The currency that mainly influences the prices at which the entity sells its goods and services.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Candide Internationale is located in France. The currency that mainly influences the prices at which it sells its goods and services is &#8364; (euro).</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case the functional currency of Candide Internationale is the &#8364; (assuming that the other factors also indicate that the &#8364; is the functional currency of Candide Internationale).</p>
</div>
<p>The currency of the country, whose competitive forces and regulations mainly influence the pricing policy of the entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example the competitive forces and laws of France mainly influence the pricing policy of Candide Internationale.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the functional currency of Candide Internationale is the &#8364; (assuming that the other factors also indicate that the &#8364; is the functional currency of Candide Internationale).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of providing these goods and services.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example Candide Internationale mainly settles its costs in &#8364;. It pays for the raw material it imports from England in &#x00A3; but these expenses are only 20% of its total expenses.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the functional currency of Candide Internationale is the &#8364; (assuming that the other factors also indicate that the &#8364; is the functional currency of Candide Internationale).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The currency in which finance is generated by the entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example Candide Internationale has raised finance through the issue of equity shares and loan notes. The equity issue and the loan notes were subscribed for and are retained in &#8364;.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the functional currency of Candide Internationale is the &#8364; (assuming that the other factors also indicate that the &#8364; is the functional currency of Candide Internationale).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>The currency in which the receipts from customers is retained by the entity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example Candide Internationale sells goods both within and outside France. For its overseas sale, it receives payment in the currency of the county of sale. However it converts this foreign currency into the &#8364; and retains it in &#8364;.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the functional currency of Candide Internationale is the &#8364;. (Assuming that the other factors also indicate that the &#8364; is the functional currency of Candide Internationale).</p>
</div>
<p>So overall, from the above examples, it would be concluded that the functional currency of Candide. Internationale is the Euro.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Foreign operations of an entity</span></p>
<p>Foreign operations of an entity include any subsidiary, associate, joint venture or branch which conducts business in a country or in a currency which is different from those of the reporting entity.</p>
<p>If the entity has any foreign operations then it has to consider a few additional factors while determining its functional currency. The additional factors are:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Whether the activities of the foreign operation are carried out as</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>an extension of the reporting entity: in this case the functional currency of the reporting entity <span class="bold">will be </span>the functional currency of the foreign operation.</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Whether the proportion of transactions which the foreign operations have with the reporting entity is high or low. If the volume is high then the functional currency of the reporting entity <span class="bold">will be </span>the functional currency of the foreign operation. If the volume is low then the functional currency of the reporting entity <span class="bold">may not be </span>the functional currency of the foreign operation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Gambtor &amp; Procle (a British entity) has a subsidiary in Bermuda. This subsidiary sells all its products to Gambtor &amp; Procle.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case the proportion of transactions which the foreign operations (the subsidiary) have with Gambtor &amp; Procle (the reporting entity) is high. Hence the functional currency of the subsidiary will be the &#x00A3; which is the functional currency of the reporting entity Gambtor &amp; Procle (assuming it satisfies the other conditions).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Whether the cash flows from the activities of the foreign operation</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>directly affect the cash flows of the reporting entity and</li>
<li>are readily available for remittance to it.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the answer is yes then the functional currency of the subsidiary will be the same as the functional currency of the reporting entity.</p>
<p>When the above indicators are mixed and the functional currency is not obvious the <span class="bold">management </span>of the reporting company <span class="bold">determines the functional currency </span>which faithfully represents the financial transactions.</p>
<p>An entity&#x2019;s functional currency reflects the underlying transactions, events and conditions that are relevant to it. Hence, once determined, the functional currency is changed only when there is a change in the underlying transactions, events and conditions.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Discuss the recording of transactions and translation of monetary/non-monetary items at the reporting date for individual entities in accordance with relevant accounting standards.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Initial recognition (IR)</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Foreign currency </span>is a currency other than the functional currency of the entity.</p>
</div>
<p>A foreign currency transaction is a transaction that is denominated or requires settlement in a foreign currency, including transactions arising when an entity:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>buys or sells goods or services whose price is denominated in a foreign currency;</li>
<li>borrows or lends funds when the amounts payable or receivable are denominated in a foreign currency; or</li>
<li>acquires or disposes of assets, or incurs or settles liabilities denominated in a foreign currency.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Convenience Inc, a company located in London, buys raw material from Bravo Co which is situated in Germany. Bravo Co raises its invoices in &#8364; and Convenience Inc has to pay for the invoice in &#8364;. The functional currency of Convenience Inc is the &#x00A3;.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case the payment made by Convenience Inc to Bravo Co in &#8364; is a foreign currency transaction.</p>
</div>
<p>At the time of initial recognition, an entity has to first determine the value at which the transaction is to be recognised in terms of foreign currency by applying the relevant accounting standard. For example, the carrying amount of a machine acquired in foreign currency should be measured under the cost model or revaluation model in accordance with IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment.</p>
<p>This initial amount is then translated into the functional currency at the <span class="bold">spot exchange rate at the date of the transaction.</span></p>
<p class="block1">Recognised in FS = Foreign currency amount x Spot exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency as on the date of the transaction</p>
<p>The date of a transaction is the <span class="bold">date on which the transaction first qualifies for recognition </span>in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards. For practical reasons a rate that is approximately the same as the actual rate at the date of the transaction is taken.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An average rate for a week or a month is used for all foreign currency transactions that occur during that period.</p>
</div>
<p>However, if exchange rates fluctuate significantly, then each transaction has to be recorded at the rate on the date of the transaction and an average rate cannot be used.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Beetles Plc, London bought music cassettes and music MP3 CDs from Elvis Co, Los Angeles on 3 September 20X4 for $270,000 when the exchange rate was &#x00A3;1 = $2. Beetles Plc closed its books on 31 December 20X4 when the rate of exchange was &#x00A3;1 = $1.75. Beetles Plc paid Elvis Co on 24 February 20X5 when the exchange rate was &#x00A3;1 = $2.05. The average rate of exchange between the two currencies was &#x00A3;1 = $1.90.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Beetles would initially record the purchase by translating $ at the spot rate of &#x00A3;1 = $2.Therefore it would record the transaction at &#x00A3;135,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alternatively, if there were many transactions in $ and &#x00A3;, and the exchange rates between the two currencies did not significantly fluctuate, Beetles would record the transaction at the average rate of &#x00A3;1 = $1.90.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Subsequent translation (ST)</span></p>
<p>For subsequent translation the foreign currency transactions are split into monetary and non-monetary items.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Monetary items are units of currency held and assets and liabilities to be received or paid in a fixed or determinable number of units of currency.</p>
</div>
<p>The standard states that the essential feature of a monetary item is the right to receive or an obligation to deliver a <span class="bold">fixed or determinable number of units of currency.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Cash and bank balance</li>
<li>Trade receivables and payables</li>
<li>Loan receivables and payables</li>
<li>Pensions and other employee benefits to be paid in cash</li>
<li>Provisions (e.g. dividend payable) that have to be settled in cash</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Non-Monetary items</span></p>
<p>The essential feature of a non-monetary item is the <span class="bold">absence of a right to receive or an obligation </span>to deliver a <span class="bold">fixed or determinable number of units of currency.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Goodwill and other intangible assets</li>
<li>Non-current assets</li>
<li>Inventories</li>
<li>Provisions that are settled by delivering a non-monetary asset</li>
<li>Prepaid expenses</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The monetary and non-monetary items are recognised in the statement of financial position in the following manner:</p>
<table class="table1" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Treatment of exchange differences</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Monetary items</span></p>
<p>The exchange difference is recognised in the statement of profit or loss <span class="bold">in the period in which the exchange difference arises.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Quebec Bottling Co, Canada, ordered glass bottles from Yamoto Glassworks, Japan for &#x00A5;720,000 on 12 May 20X7. The bottles were delivered to Quebec Bottling, Canada on 27 May 20X7. On this date, the rate of exchange was C$1 = &#x00A5;120.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Quebec would make the following entry in its books of accounts:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p218-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Quebec made its payment to Yamoto on 30 June 20X7. On this date the rate of exchange was C$1 = &#x00A5;125.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The journal entry to record this payment would be as follows:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p218-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note: </span>that there is a difference in exchange rates on 27 May 20X7, i.e. the date of delivery, and 30 June 20X7 i.e. the date the payment was made. In order to account for this change in exchange rates, Quebec could alter its inventory values by making a counter entry to the one to record the delivery. Alternatively, and more appropriately, Quebec could record a gain on the transaction or a profit on conversion of C$240.</p>
<p class="boxpara">If, on the other hand the exchange rate had fallen to C$1 = &#x00A5;115, there would have been an exchange loss of C$261 (C$6,261 &#x2013; C$6,000) recorded in Quebec&#x2019;s books.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The journal entry to record the transaction would have been as follows:</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Distinguish between reporting and functional currencies.</span></p>
<p>The term <span class="bold">&#x2018;reporting currency&#x2019; </span>was defined in the previous IAS 21 (1993) as &#x2018;the currency used in presenting the financial statements&#x2019;.</p>
<p>Reporting currency was split into two parts:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">measurement currency:</span> the currency in which the entity measures the items in the financial statements; and</li>
<li>The <span class="bold">presentation currency:</span> the currency in which the entity presents its financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Standard did not specify the currency in which an entity should present its financial statements though it noted that an entity would normally use the currency of the country in which it was located.</p>
<p>The revised IAS 21 (2005) has separated these two parts and given them each its own identity.</p>
<p>The revised IAS 21 uses the terms:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">functional currency:</span> this term replaces the term measurement currency and was adopted as it is more common. It is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.</li>
<li>The <span class="bold">presentation currency:</span> the currency in which the entity presents its financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus the main difference between reporting and functional currencies is that</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Reporting currency includes both measurement currency and presentation currency while</li>
<li>Functional currency means measurement currency only.</li>
</ul>

<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>What is the main difference between reporting and functional currency?</p>
<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>When borrowing costs are capitalised according to the requirements of IAS 23 &#x2018;Borrowing Costs&#x2019; then any exchange differences are also capitalised and not recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
