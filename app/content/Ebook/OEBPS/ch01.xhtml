<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Need for International Accounting Standards</span></p>
<p>International Accounting Standards are a single set of high quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards. The idea is that these same standards are used across the globe by companies, so financial statements can be prepared and compared on the same basis.</p>
<p>They are needed for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. To prevent material manipulations or errors in financial statements</span></p>
<p>In order to avoid manipulation of figures in the financial accounts, there needs to be a consistent way of deciding which elements are recognised and measured, and how information is presented in the financial statements.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. To ensure that items are treated in a consistent manner or an explanation is given as to why not</span></p>
<p>Accounting is not a subject where the results are always the same whoever does it. For example, in mathematics, 2 plus 2 must always equal 4; but in accounts, a figure for (say) profit or loss may vary, sometimes vastly, depending upon the subjective judgments of the person doing the calculations. It is important that explanations are given to help the user of financial statements make correct decisions.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. To help in global harmonisation</span></p>
<p>Unless accounting activities are regulated across the globe, different entities in different countries will apply their own rules, which are unlikely to be harmonious. The process of global harmonisation leads to global accounting standards. Global standards will help global trade and global economic growth as all users will be able to use the same standards to analyse the financial statements of any company, whether in the UK, Poland, Singapore or Australia.</p>
<p>The process of global harmonisation of standards is not complete. There are countries like North America and India which use their own standards. However, now most of the national standard setters are harmonising their standards with the international standards.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 The International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC)</span></p>
<p>The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) was previously run as the IASC, which operated from 1973 until 2001. The<span class="bold"> IASC was founded in June 1973 </span>as a result of an agreement by accountancy bodies in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland and the US. These countries formed the Board of IASC initially. The purpose of the Board was to<span class="bold"> work towards the improvement and harmonisation of accounting standards and reporting.</span> In March 2001, as part of a restructuring, the IASC Foundation was set up in Delaware as a not-for-profit entity. The IASC in turn gave approval for the IASB to assume standard-setting responsibilities.</p>
<p class="h2A"><span class="bold">IASC Foundation became IFRS Foundation on 1 July 2010.</span></p>
<p>On 1 July 2010, the IASC Foundation has formally changed its name to the IFRS Foundation. The change represents the next step in a process to simplify the names in use across the organisation which was announced following the conclusion of the Constitutional Review in 2010. The International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee and the Standards Advisory Council are also renamed as the IFRS Interpretations Committee and the IFRS Advisory Council, respectively. The name of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) remains unchanged.</p>
<p>The objectives of the IFRS Foundation, as stated in its constitution, are:</p>
<ul class="arr1">
<li>To<span class="bold"> develop,</span> in the public interest, a<span class="bold"> single set of high-quality, understandable and enforceable global accounting standards </span>that require high-quality, transparent and comparable information in financial statements and other financial reporting to help participants in the world's capital markets and other users make economic decisions.</li>
<li>To <span class="bold">promote the use </span>and rigorous application of those standards.</li>
<li>In fulfilling the objectives associated with (a) and (b),<span class="bold"> to take account,</span> as appropriate, of the special needs of<span class="bold"> small and medium-sized entities </span>and emerging economies.</li>
<li>To bring about<span class="bold"> convergence of national accounting standards </span>and IASs and IFRSs to high-quality solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. The structure of the IFRS Foundation</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The monitoring board</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The Foundation is governed by trustees.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>There are 22 trustees, appointed as follows:</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">i. </span>6 from North America;</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>6 from Europe;</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>6 from the Asia / Oceania region; and</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">iv. </span>4 from any area, subject to establishing overall geographical balance.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">d) </span>The trustees should comprise individuals from different professional backgrounds such as auditor&#x2019;s preparers, users and academicians.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">e) </span>They should meet at least twice each year.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: The structure of the IFRS Foundation and its components</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="bold">(Source: <a href="http://www.iasb.org" target="_blank">www.iasb.org</a>)</span></p>
<p class="h2A"><span class="bold">Monitoring Board</span></p>
<p>The primary purpose of the Monitoring Board is to serve as a mechanism for formal interaction between the IFRS Foundation and the capital market authorities that allow or require the use of IFRS in their jurisdictions to effectively discharge their mandates relating to investor protection, market integrity and capital formation.</p>
<p>This step has increased the public accountability of the IFRS Foundation while not impairing the standard setting process.<span class="bold"></span></p>

<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>IASB has issued the standards in the form of red and blue book.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Red Book </span>&#x2013; contains the form of IFRSs, which considers all issued standards until publication of the book, i.e. a book for the year of 2011 includes e.g. IFRS 9, although this standard comes into effect from January 1, 2013. The book is published in the spring (April x May) of 2011.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Blue Book </span>&#x2013; contains the form of IFRSs, which considers only standards effective for that year, i.e. a book for the year of 2011 considers standards that came to effect from 1 January 2011 or earlier. The book is always published at the end of the previous year.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. The Framework.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Meaning of conceptual framework of accounting</span></p>
<p>The IFRS Framework gives a set of concepts in certain basic areas about the why, what and how of the accounting process and the financial statements e.g. whether an item should be recognised as an asset or not. In this Study Guide, we take an overview of these concepts, so as to understand what the overall framework is. Many of these important concepts have been covered in separate Study Guides within these materials.</p>
<p>It is to be noted that the Framework is concerned with<span class="bold"> general purpose financial statements. </span>It does not cover special statements such as prospectuses. Similarly, the Framework<span class="bold"> is not itself an International Accounting Standard; </span>it does not define standards for any particular measurement or disclosure issue.</p>
<p>The Framework includes the following matters:</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Objectives of financial statements</span></p>
<p>This is a fundamental concept. Before we do anything, we need to be clear about why we are doing it, i.e. why we are preparing financial statements. This concept tells us as to why we perform accounting.</p>
<p>The objective of financial statements is to provide financial information about the reporting entity that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the entity.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Components of financial statements</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 3: Components of financial statements</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/fig3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Note: </span>Amendment to IAS 1 on 16th June 2011 has introduced change in the title of the statement of comprehensive income. The revised title is &#x2018;Statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income&#x2019;.</p>
<p>* Changes in entity&#x2019;s economic resources and claims not resulting from financial performance.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.4 Qualitative characteristics</span></p>
<p>In order to fulfil their purpose, the statements must possess certain qualities. These essential qualities, without which the statements would lose their value, are listed in the diagram given below.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Conceptual Framework for the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the qualitative characteristics are divided into two main groups:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Fundamental qualitative characteristics</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Enhancing qualitative characteristics</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 4: Characteristics of financial statements</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/fig4.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Fundamental qualitative characteristics</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) Relevance</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Relevant financial information is capable of making a difference in the decisions made by users. Information may be capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources.</p>
</div>
<p>The relevance of the information is related to the decision-making needs of users. How does the information help in making decisions? A person evaluates past, present and future events and then arrives at a decision. He can also confirm or correct his past evaluations. Financial information is capable of making a difference in decisions if it has<span class="bold"> confirmative value, predictive value or both. </span>The predictive value and confirmatory value of financial information are interrelated. Information that has predictive value often also has confirmatory value.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Financial information has predictive value if it can be used as an input for processes employed by users to predict future outcomes.</span></p>
<p>Financial information has confirmatory value if it provides feedback (confirms or changes) about previous evaluations. Some information may be of such a kind that the amount involved may not be material for the financial statements, but its<span class="bold"> existence needs to be disclosed </span>in order to assess the risk and opportunities in the future.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Faithful representation</span></p>
<p>People say that the financial statements &#x2018;talk&#x2019; to us. Each statement and each figure in the financial statements communicates or &#x2018;represents&#x2019; something to us. Representation is information that the item purports to give or is expected to give. Therefore, the statement of financial position represents the transactions and other events that result in assets, liabilities and equity of the entity at the reporting date which meet the recognition criteria. The statement of profit or loss represents the transactions and other events that result in revenue or expenses of the entity which meet the recognition criteria.</p>
<p>Similarly, the<span class="bold"> cash flow statement </span>represents the flows of cash and cash equivalents during the period.</p>
<p class="h2A"><span class="bold">Faithful</span></p>
<p>The word &#x2018;faithful&#x2019; or its alternative, &#x2018;true and fair&#x2019;, indicates truthfulness and fairness in the representations. In the previous section, we saw how each statement or each item therein represents something to us. If all representations are reliable and fair, we call them faithful representations.</p>
<p>The question is when do we treat a representation as being faithful or true and fair?</p>
<p>Financial information that faithfully represents economic phenomena has three characteristics:</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>Complete: </span>a complete depiction would include all the information necessary for the user to understand the phenomenon being depicted along with all necessary description and explanations.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the case of a group of assets, a complete depiction would include, at a minimum:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>description of nature of assets</li>
<li>numerical depiction of all the assets in the group</li>
<li>special classification, if any (assets held for sale)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>Neutral: </span>a neutral depiction is without bias in the selection or presentation of financial information. A neutral depiction is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, de-emphasised or otherwise manipulated to increase the probability that financial information will be received favourably or unfavourably by users.</p>
<p class="hangR-para">It should be noted that neutral information does not mean information with no purpose or no influence on behaviour. On the contrary, relevant financial information is, by definition, capable of making a difference in users&#x2019; decisions.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>Free from errors: </span>this means there are no errors or omissions in the description of the phenomenon, and the process used to produce the reported information has been selected and applied with no errors in the process. In this context, free from error does not mean perfectly accurate in all respects.</p>
<p class="hangR-para">Faithful representation, however, is achieved if no errors or omissions affect the description of economic phenomena and the process applied to produce reported information has been selected and applied without errors.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Enhancing qualitative characteristics</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) Comparability</span></p>
<p>Comparability is one of the enhancing qualitative characteristics in accordance with the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting 2010. Comparability helps the users to identify and understand similarities in, and differences among items. A comparison requires at least two items for comparison.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Comparability in financial statements is of two kinds</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>Within the entity over time: </span>the user should be able to compare the amounts of different periods and identify trends, if any, in the financial position and performance.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>Between different entities: </span>the user should find it possible to evaluate the relative financial position, changes in financial position and performance of the entity.</p>
<p><span class="bold">In order to make the financial statements comparable in this manner, certain requirements have to be fulfilled.</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>There should be<span class="bold"> consistency in the measurement and display </span>of the financial effects of like transactions and events.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Users </span>should be<span class="bold"> informed of the accounting policies, changes in those policies and effects of the changes.</span> Compliance with IFRS helps in ensuring comparability. (This is an important issue and is discussed separately in the next sections of this Study Guide.)</li>
<li><span class="bold">Corresponding information </span>for the previous period should be<span class="bold"> disclosed.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Understandability</span></p>
<p>Financial statements are intended to provide certain information to users. These users are likely to use the information to make economic decisions and must therefore be able to understand the contents of the statements.</p>
<p>The objective of understandability is achieved with the help of the following<span class="bold"> essential components:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Those preparing the statements<span class="bold"> present / disclose full information that is essential </span>for the<span class="bold"> understanding </span>of the statements, and present it in an understandable manner.</li>
<li>Users have a<span class="bold"> reasonable knowledge </span>of business and economic activities and accounting principles, and show willingness to study the information.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">c) Verifiability</span></p>
<p>Information has the quality of verifiability when different knowledgeable and independent observers could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a particular depiction is a faithful representation. If<span class="bold"> users are to take decisions </span>based on the financial statements, the information in the statements has to be verifiable; otherwise<span class="bold"> it would not be of any help even if it is relevant.</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">d) Timeliness</span></p>
<p>Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to be capable of influencing their decisions. Generally, the older the information is, the less useful it is. For the users of general purpose financial statements, the information is useful for decision making only if it is timely.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.5 The elements of financial statements</span><a href="videos/The IASB and Regulatory Framework_Part2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>The items reflected in financial statements are the financial effects of transactions and events. Based on their economic characteristics, they need to be grouped into broad classes for presentation in the financial statements. These broad classes are called the &#x2018;elements&#x2019; of financial statements. They are as follows:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Definition of asset</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An<span class="bold"> asset </span>is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Breaking down this definition</span></p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>A resource controlled by the entity</p></td>
<td><p>The important word is &#x2018;control&#x2019;. If the resource is not controlled by the entity, it cannot be considered an asset in financial accounting terms. For example, a building is a resource which is &#x2018;controlled&#x2019;, as the entity has the option of using the building in whichever way it wants to. However, staff of the entity cannot be considered an asset, as they can leave the company at any time, therefore are not &#x2018;controlled&#x2019; by the entity</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>As a result of past events</p></td>
<td><p>Something must have happened in the past, to ensure that the asset has the right to be controlled by the entity. So, the building discussed above, was purchased by the company this act, in the past, means that the right to use the building passed to the company.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>From which future economic benefits are expected to flow</p></td>
<td><p>The whole point of an asset is that it should help generate revenue for the entity. Thus the building could be used to produce goods for sale, or to provide services for customers. Hence the building meets this part of the definition. Conversely, a receivable who has now become insolvent, should be removed as an asset as there are no longer expected to produce future benefits (the money owed will not be received).</p></td>

<p>An asset may be classified as &#x2018;current&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-current&#x2019;. Examples of assets include buildings, property, plant and machinery, inventories, etc.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A<span class="bold"> liability </span>is a present obligation of the entity arising from past events, the settlement of which is expected to result in an outflow from the entity of resources embodying economic benefits.</p>

<p>The same logic shown above in the case of assets can be applied here for liabilities. Similarly, a liability may be classified as &#x2018;current&#x2019; or &#x2018;non-current&#x2019;. Examples of liabilities include trade payable, provisions, outstanding expenses, etc.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Definition of Equity</span></p>

<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Equity </span>is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.</p>
</div>
<p>Effectively this is the remaining amount after deducting all liabilities from assets, which is owed to the equity holders of the entity. Examples of equity include ordinary shares, capital reserves, revenue reserves etc.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Definition of Income</span></p>
<div class="definition">

<table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>Increase in economic benefits</p></td>
<td><p>The entity should see an increase in economic benefits e.g. cash through sales etc.</p></td>

<p>The definition specifically removes any contributions for shares from shareholders from being counted as income.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Examples of income include sales revenue, dividends received, consultancy receipts etc.</p>
<p>The concept of income for the purpose of IFRS is much wider than its usual meaning. The concept also includes within its scope gains and incomes such as unrealised gains, revaluation gains etc.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">5. Definition of Expenses</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Expenses are decreases in economic benefits during the accounting period in the form of outflows or depletions of assets or incurrences of liabilities that result in decreases in equity, other than those relating to distributions to equity participants.</p>
</div>
<p>The same logic shown above in income can be used here for expenses. Examples of expenses include operating expenses, administrative expenses, selling expenses etc.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.6 Recognition</span></p>
<p>In addition to giving the definitions of the elements of financial statements, the Framework also explains the recognition criteria i.e. the conditions subject to which items may be shown in the financial statements.</p>
<p>An <span class="bold"> item can be recognised </span>in the financial statements if:</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">i. </span></span>It meets the<span class="bold"> definition </span>of an element</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span></span>It satisfies the recognition criteria:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>It is<span class="bold"> probable </span>that any<span class="bold"> future economic benefit </span>associated with the item will flow to or from the entity.</li>
<li>The cost or value of the element can be<span class="bold"> measured reliably.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. The use of IFRS around the world.</span></p>
<p>Accounting standards are the basic guidelines on which an entity prepares its financial statements. Different sets of accounting standards are followed by different economies throughout the globe; however, the basic objective of all these sets of standards is to derive high quality financial statements that provide its varied stakeholders with required information that is essential for proper economic decisions. But due to differences between national accounting standards, the same financial transaction may be accounted for in different ways in different countries.</p>
<p>The above scenario continued till many years, but now, due to globalisation, all the economies are under pressure to harmonise financial reporting standards and move towards a single set of global accounting standards. The pressures are felt on account of the need to reduce inconsistencies, promote comparability, reduce compliance cost and minimise barriers for global trade and cross border investments.</p>
<p>International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) has evolved as a solution to this harmonisation problem, and countries throughout the globe have adopted IFRS, or converged their national accounting standards to IFRS, or are in the process of adopting or converging.</p>
<p>There are more than eighty countries which made it mandatory for some or all of the domestic companies to use IFRS for the preparation of financial statements. There are various other countries which had not made it mandatory but still permit the use of IFRS for domestic companies. Apart from these countries, there are other important countries which do not intend to scrap their national standards, and are working towards convergence i.e. amending their national accounting standards so that they are brought in line with IFRS.</p>
<p><span class="bold">IFRS adoption in major economies (landmarks in the process of international harmonisation)</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The European Union</span></p>
<p>On 19 July 2002, a regulation was passed by the European Parliament. This was the first major landmark in the process of harmonisation as a result of this Regulation, and all EU listed companies were required to prepare their financial statements following IFRS from 2005.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The United States</span></p>
<p>The United States, which is the most influential world economy, is yet to adopt IFRS. However, as a result of the Norwalk agreement, it is working with the IASB to develop high quality standards and thus, even the US is set to converge to IFRS in the coming years. The Norwalk Agreement refers to a Memorandum of Understanding signed in October 2002 between the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the US accounting standard setting body, and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). This move initiated in October 2002 a significant step towards the convergence of US GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Australia</span></p>
<p>The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) issued 'Australian equivalents to IFRS, SIC and IFRICs. These standards replaced previous Australian generally accepted accounting principles with effect from reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Canada</span></p>
<p>The use of IFRS has become mandatory for Canadian publicly accountable profit-oriented enterprises for financial periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011.</p>
<p><span class="bold">South Africa</span></p>
<p>All companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange have been required to comply with the requirements of the International Financial Reporting Standards since 1 January 2005.</p>

<p>The major developments since the inception of IASB/IASC are listed below:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The IASC was founded in 1973.</li>
<li>The IASC published the first version of the conceptual Framework in 1989.</li>
<li>Commonwealth countries started adopting IASs as national standards in the 1990s.</li>
<li>Ten IAS were revised in 1993.</li>
<li>IASC and IOSCO agreed on a list of core standards in 1995.</li>
<li>In 2001, the IASB was founded as a successor to IASC and was now responsible for setting the accounting standards.</li>
<li>IASB and FASB agreed on a roadmap for convergence between IFRS and US GAAP in 2006.</li>
<li>India, Japan and Canada agreed timelines for convergence in 2007.</li>
<li>In July 2009, the IASB issued a separate standard intended to apply to general purpose financial statements, and other financial reporting of small and medium-sized entities (SMEs), private entities, and non-publicly accountable entities. The standard is called the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs).</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Applicability of SME standard</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Small and medium-sized entities are entities that:</p>

</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">6. IFRS 1 First time adoption of IFRS.</span></p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>In order to understand this Learning Outcome we suggest that you study the rest of the book first.</p>
</div>
<p>Prior to the introduction of International Accounting Standards, later known as International Financial Reporting Standards, there was no uniformity in the accounting principles followed internationally. IASB designed these international standards to bring about homogeneity in the standards being followed all over the world.</p>
<p>However, changing over from the existing system to the IFRS has to be done methodically, so as to ensure that the readers are not misled and sufficient information is given. IFRS 1, First-time adoption of international financial reporting standards was issued by IASB to address these concerns. These are discussed in the following paragraphs.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.1 First IFRS financial statements</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity&#x2019;s<span class="bold"> first IFRS financial statements </span>are the first annual financial statements in which the entity adopts IFRSs, by an explicit and unreserved statement in those financial statements of compliance with IFRSs.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.2 Opening IFRS Statement of financial position</span></p>
<p>At the date of transition, an entity shall prepare an opening IFRS statement of financial position. This serves as a starting point for transition to IFRS.</p>
<p>In the opening financial statements the entity should:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>recognise all assets and liabilities which are required to be recognised under IFRS.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>derecognise items as assets or liabilities if IFRS does not permit such recognition.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>reclassify items of assets, liability or components of equity that it recognised under previous GAAP, which are recognised differently under IFRS.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iv. </span>apply IFRS while measuring the above recognised assets and liabilities.</p>
<p>According to Para 7 of IFRS 1, an entity shall use the same accounting policies in its opening IFRS statement of financial position and throughout all periods presented in its first IFRS financial statements. Those accounting policies shall comply with each IFRS effective at the reporting date for its first IFRS financial statements, except as specified in paragraphs 13 &#x2013; 34. It is likely that the accounting policies that were applied earlier to the opening statement of financial position were different from those required so as to comply with the IFRS. Some amounts reflecting events and transactions of an earlier date may have to be restated so as to comply with IFRS. These adjustments are recognised directly in the retained earnings or another category of equity at the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An asset is valued at $50,000 according to the earlier accounting policy. According to IFRS, its value is $40,000 only. $10,000 (50,000 - 40,000) will be reduced from the value of the asset as well as retained earnings in the opening IFRS statement of financial position.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.3 Exemptions from other IFRSs</span></p>
<p>As stated above, the opening statement of financial position should follow all the IFRSs that are effective on that date. In effect, it means that there should be a retrospective application of the IFRSs. However, IAS 1 provides for two kinds of exemptions to this retrospective application: optional and mandatory.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.4 Optional Exemptions</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Business combinations</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>A first-time adopter may opt not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to past business combinations (those that occurred before the date of transition to IFRSs).</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>However, if a first-time adopter opts to restate any business combination to comply with IFRS 3, it shall restate all later business combinations. It shall also apply revised IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (as revised in 2004) and IAS 38 Intangible Assets (as revised in 2004) from that same date. The exemption for business combinations is also applicable to acquisitions of investments in associates and interests in joint ventures.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company adapts IFRS for the first time on for a reporting date of 31 December 2007. It elects to restate the business combination that occurred on 1 July 2004. All the business combinations after 1 July 2004 must be restated and the provisions of IAS 36 (as revised in 2004) and 38 (as revised in 2004) applied.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Fair value or revaluation as deemed cost</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Instead of at actual cost, a first-time adopter can elect to measure an item of property, plant and equipment at the date of transition to IFRSs at its fair value and use that fair value as its deemed cost at that date.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Previous GAAP revaluation may be retained if it is broadly comparable to fair value or cost / depreciated cost as per IFRS.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>These exemptions are also available for investment properties and intangible assets. In the case of intangible assets the option is available only if there is an active market for such assets.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>In some jurisdictions, local law requires revaluation of assets and liabilities to fair value for a privatisation or initial public offering (IPO) and treats the revalued amounts as deemed cost for the entity&#x2019;s previous GAAP. In such a case, first-time adopters are allowed to use event-driven fair value as deemed cost, even if the event occurs after the date of transition, but before the first IFRS financial statements are issued.</p>
<p>Note the difference between IAS 16 and IFRS 1</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>Under IAS 16, the entire class has to be revalued, whereas under IFRS 1 exemption can be applied to individual items.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>Application of IFRS 1 is a one-time affair whereas revaluation of assets under revaluation model is to be performed regularly.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Employee benefits</span></p>
<p>If an entity adopts the corridor approach to accounting for employee retirement benefits under IAS 19, some actuarial gains and losses (those above the corridor) may be left unrecognised. By applying this approach retrospectively, an entity should split the cumulative actuarial gains and losses from the inception of the plan until the date of transition to IFRS into a recognised portion and an unrecognised portion. However, IFRS1 allows an exemption whereby all the cumulative actuarial gains and losses can be recognised at the date of transition to IFRS. If a first-time adopter elects to do this, it shall apply it (recognition of all cumulative gains and losses in statement of profit or loss at the date of transition to IFRS) to all plans.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Cumulative translation differences</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>IAS 21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates requires an entity to classify some translation differences as a part of equity. IAS further requires that, on disposal of a foreign operation, the entity shall transfer the cumulative translation difference related to that foreign operation to the statement of profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>However, a first-time adopter can transfer the cumulative translation differences to accumulated profits and set the translation reserve to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs. The gain or loss on a subsequent disposal of any foreign operation shall exclude translation differences that arose before the date of transition to IFRS and shall include later translation differences.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">5. Compound financial instruments</span></p>
<p>IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation requires an entity to split a compound financial instrument at inception into separate liability and equity components. Retrospective application of IAS 32, when the liability component is no longer outstanding, involves separating two components of equity. The part representing cumulative interest accreted on the liability component is the part of retained earnings. The other part represents the original equity component. If the liability component is no longer outstanding, under this IFRS, a first-time adopter need not separate these two portions at the date of transition to IFRSs.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">6. Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures</span></p>
<p>The accounting for the assets and liabilities of a subsidiary depends upon which of the parent and the subsidiary becomes the FTA later.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>If a subsidiary becomes a first-time adopter later than its parent, the subsidiary has the following two choices:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">i. </span>the carrying amounts that would be included in the parent&#x2019;s consolidated financial statements, are based on the<span class="bold"> parent&#x2019;s date of transition to IFRSs,</span> or</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>the carrying amounts required by the rest of this IFRS, based<span class="bold"> on the subsidiary&#x2019;s date of transition to IFRSs.</span></p>
<p>The values in the two options given above would differ from each other when:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the exemption under IFRS 1 depends upon the date of transition to IFRS</li>
<li>the accounting policies used in the subsidiary&#x2019;s financial statements differ from those in the consolidated financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p>A similar election is available to an associate or joint venture that becomes a first-time adopter later than an entity that has significant influence or joint control over it.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>If an entity becomes a first-time adopter later than its subsidiary (or associate or joint venture) the entity shall, in<span class="bold"> its consolidated financial statements,</span> measure the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary (or associate or joint venture)<span class="bold"> at the same carrying amounts as in the financial statements of the subsidiary </span>(or associate or joint venture), after adjusting for consolidation and equity accounting adjustments and for the effects of the business combination in which the entity acquired the subsidiary.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">7. Designation of previously recognised financial instruments</span></p>
<p>IFRS 9 allows a financial liability (provided it meets certain criteria) to be designated as a financial liability at fair value through profit or loss. Despite this requirement, an entity is permitted to designate, at the date of transition to IFRSs, any financial liability (even though it does not meet the required criteria) as at fair value through profit or loss provided the liability meets the criteria stated in IAS 39 at that date.</p>
<p>An entity may designate a financial asset as measured at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with IFRS 9 on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist at the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<p>An entity may designate an investment in an equity instrument as at fair value through other comprehensive income in accordance with IFRS 9 on the basis of the facts and circumstances existing on the date of transition.</p>
<p>If it is impracticable (as defined in IAS 8) for an entity to retrospectively apply the effective interest method or the impairment requirements, the fair value of the financial asset at the date of transition to IFRS shall be the new amortised cost of that financial asset at the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">8. Share-based payment transactions</span></p>
<p>A first-time adopter is encouraged, but not required:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to equity instruments that were granted on or before 7 November 2002.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>to apply IFRS 2 to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002 that vested before:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>the date of transition to IFRSs and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>1 January 2005, whichever is later</p>
<p>An entity may do so only if the entity has disclosed publicly the fair value of those equity instruments determined at the measurement date, as defined in IFRS 2.</p>
<p>If IFRS 2 has not been applied (e.g. equity instruments granted on or before 7 November 2002), a first-time adopter should still disclose certain information as required by IFRS 2.</p>
<p>Similar provisions exist for the liabilities arising out of share based payments.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">9. Decommissioning liabilities included in the cost of property, plant and equipment</span></p>
<p>IFRIC 1 Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and Similar Liabilities has clarified that</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>specified changes in a decommissioning, restoration or similar liability should be added to or deducted from the cost of the asset to which it relates;</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is then depreciated prospectively over its remaining useful life.</p>
<p>A first-time adopter need not comply with these requirements for changes in such liabilities that occurred before the date of transition to IFRSs.</p>
<p>However, if this exemption is used, the entity shall:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>measure the liability as at the date of transition to IFRSs in accordance with IAS 37;</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>to the extent the liability is under IFRIC 1, estimate the amount that would have been included in the cost of the related asset when the liability first arose, by discounting the liability to that date using its best estimate of the historical risk-adjusted discount rate(s) that would have applied for that liability over the intervening period; and</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>calculate the accumulated depreciation on that amount, as at the date of transition to IFRSs, on the basis of the current estimate of the useful life of the asset, using the depreciation policy adopted by the entity under IFRS.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">10. Borrowing costs</span></p>
<p>A first-time adopter can elect to apply the requirements of IAS 23 from the date of transition or from an earlier date as permitted by IAS 23. From the date an entity that applied this exemption begins to apply IAS 23, the entity:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>shall not restate the borrowing cost component that was capitalised under previous GAAP and that was included in the carrying amount of assets at that date; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>shall account for borrowing costs incurred on or after that date in accordance with IAS 23, including those borrowing costs incurred on or after that date on qualifying assets already under construction.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.5 Additional exemptions for First-time Adopters</span></p>
<p>IFRS 1 &#x2018;First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards&#x2019; was amended on 23 July 2009 in order to provide relief from the full retrospective application of IFRS, for the measurement of oil and gas assets and leases. This amendment is effective from 1 January 2010 although earlier application is permitted, which should be disclosed.</p>
<p>The two amendments made are as follows:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Oil and gas assets</span></p>
<p>Companies operating in the oil and gas sector capitalise oil and gas assets using the full cost accounting method. This method of accounting is not consistent with the IFRS. The recent amendment allows first time adopters of IFRS to carry forward the amount determined under the old GAAP as the &#x201C;deemed cost&#x201D; under IFRS. This amendment will benefit those organisations which have to determine the cost of oil and gas assets through a long and expensive process or those organisations which do not have data on such costs available till date.</p>
<p>On transition, these assets would be tested for impairment in accordance with IFRS 6, Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources or IAS 36, Impairment of Assets, and adjusted accordingly to ensure that the assets are not stated at more than their recoverable amount.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Lease arrangements</span></p>
<p>Under IFRIC 4 &#x2018;Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease&#x2019;, at the inception of an arrangement, an entity is required to make an assessment as to whether the arrangement contains a lease.</p>
<p>Amendments to IFRS 1 will exempt first time adopters with existing leasing contracts from reassessing the classification of their existing arrangements in accordance with IFRIC 4, to determine whether the arrangement contains a lease. However such entities should ensure that while taking the benefit of this new amendment the outcome resulting from the arrangement should be the same as determined under the old GAAP.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.6 Mandatory exemptions &#x2013; Exemption from retrospective application of other IFRSs</span></p>
<p>IFRS 1 prohibits retrospective application of certain aspects of other IFRS. These relate to:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities</span></p>
<p>If an entity derecognised non-derivative financial assets or non-derivative financial liabilities in accordance with its previous GAAP before 1<sup>st</sup> January 2001, it should not recognise those assets and liabilities under IFRS unless they qualify for recognition as a result of a later transaction or event.</p>
<p>However, a first-time adopter should recognise all derivatives and other interests retained after derecognition and still existing, and consolidate all special-purpose entities (SPE) that it controls at the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Hedge accounting</span></p>
<p>An entity is required, at the date of transition to IFRS, to measure all derivatives at fair value and eliminate all deferred losses and gains on derivatives that were reported under its previous GAAP.</p>
<p>However, the entity should not reflect a hedging relationship in its opening IFRS statement of financial position if it does not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39. Transitional provisions of IAS 39 apply to hedging relationships of a first-time adopter at the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Estimates</span></p>
<p>An entity&#x2019;s estimates under IFRS at the date of transition to IFRS should be consistent with estimates made for the same date under its previous GAAP, unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error, as that term is defined under IFRS.</p>
<p>Any information an entity receives after the date of transition to IFRS about estimates it made under previous GAAP should be treated by it as a non-adjusting event after the date of the statement of financial position, and accorded the treatment prescribed by IAS 10 (i.e. by making a disclosure in the footnotes as opposed to an actual adjustment of items in the financial statements).</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Non-controlling interests</span></p>
<p>This exception applies for entities that adopt amendments to IAS 27 in their first IFRS financial statements. The exception requires that a first-time adopter should apply the following requirements of IAS 27 prospectively from the date of transition:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>total comprehensive income shall be attributed to the owners of the parent and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in a deficit balance for the non-controlling interests;</li>
<li>requirements regarding accounting for changes in a parent&#x2019;s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control; and</li>
<li>requirements regarding accounting for a loss of control over a subsidiary, and the related requirements of IFRS 5.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if a first-time adopter opts to apply IFRS 3 (revised) retrospectively, it shall restate all the later business combinations.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">5. Relief from retrospective application of IFRS in relation to Government grant</span></p>
<p>The IASB has amended IFRS 1, &#x2018;First- time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards&#x2019;, to provide relief from the retrospective application of IFRSs in relation to government loans.</p>
<p>IAS 20 requires entities to measure government loans with a below-market rate of interest at fair value on initial recognition. The general requirement in IFRS 1 for first- time adopters to apply IFRS retrospectively at the date of transition to IFRSs could mean some entities have to measure such government loans at fair value at a date before the date of transition to IFRS.</p>
<p>The amendment in IFRS 1 now requires first-time adopters to apply the requirements in IFRS 9, &#x2018;Financial instruments&#x2019;, and IAS 20, &#x2018;Accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance&#x2019;, prospectively to government loans that exist at the date of transition to IFRS. This will give first-time adopters some relief from retrospective computation which needs to be computed using significant unobservable inputs.</p>
<p>Management should use the requirements of IAS 32, &#x2018;Financial instruments: Presentation&#x2019;, to determine whether government loans are classified as equity or as a financial liability.</p>
<p>However, entities may choose to apply the requirements of IFRS 9 (or IAS 39, as applicable) and IAS 20 to government loans retrospectively if the information needed to do so had been obtained at the time of initially accounting for those loan</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.7 Temporary exemption from the requirement to restate comparative information for IFRS 9</span></p>
<p>In its first IFRS financial statements, an entity that adopts IFRS for annual periods beginning before 1 January 2012, and which applies IFRS 9, shall present at least one year of comparative information. However, this comparative information need not comply with IFRS 9 or IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to the extent that the disclosures required by IFRS 7 relate to items within the scope of IFRS 9.</p>
<p>For such entities, references to the &#x2018;date of transition to IFRSs&#x2019; shall mean, in the case of IFRS 9 and IFRS 7 only, the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.8 Accounting policies in the first IFRS statements</span></p>
<p>The accounting policies followed in the first IFRS statements shall follow each IFRS effective at the reporting date, except where exemptions are provided for specifically.</p>
<p>However, if a first-time adopter changes its accounting policies or its use of the exemptions in IFRS 1 from those used in its published interim financial report prepared in accordance with IAS 34, it needs to explain those changes and update the reconciliations between the previous GAAP and IFRS.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.9 Estimates</span></p>
<p>According to Para 31 of IFRS 1, an entity&#x2019;s estimates under IFRSs at the date of transition to IFRSs shall be consistent with estimates made for the same date under previous GAAP (after adjustments to reflect any difference in accounting policies), unless there is objective evidence that those estimates were in error.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company had estimated a net realisable value of an inventory at $10,000 according to earlier GAAP. There is no difference in accounting policy while making transition to IFRS. The company will retain the value of $10,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.10 Comparative information</span></p>
<p>An entity&#x2019;s first financial statements shall include at least one year of comparative information under IFRS, so as to comply with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.11 Reconciliations (Explanation of transition to IFRSs)</span></p>
<p>It is likely that the transition from previous GAAP to IFRS will affect its financial position, performance and cash flows. An entity has to provide for reconciliations as follows:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a reconciliation of its equity reported under previous GAAP to its equity under IFRSs at the date of transition as well as the date of most recent annual financial statements under previous GAAP</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a reconciliation of the profit or loss reported under previous GAAP for the latest period in the entity&#x2019;s most recent annual financial statements to its total comprehensive income under IFRSs for the same period; and</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>if the entity recognised or reversed any impairment losses for the first time in preparing its opening IFRS statement of financial position, the disclosures that IAS 36 Impairment of Assets would have required if the entity had recognised those impairment losses or reversals in the period beginning with the date of transition to IFRSs.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.12 Designation of financial assets and financial liabilities</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>According to IFRS, the financial assets and liabilities can be stated at fair values, transferring the difference between the designated values and the carrying values to the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Disclosures of the previous values and the changes are to be made</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.13 Use of fair value for other assets</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>IFRSs permit the use of fair values for the purpose of presentation in the statement of financial position for certain assets such as property, plant and equipment, an investment property or an intangible asset</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The following disclosures are required:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the aggregate of those fair values; and</li>
<li>the aggregate adjustment to the carrying amounts reported under previous GAAP.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">6.14 Interim financial reports</span></p>
<p>The provisions of IFRS 1 apply to the interim financial reports of the entity presented under IAS 34. While presenting the interim financial reports, the entity is required to provide the reconciliations and material adjustments to the SOCF similar to full financial statements.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>The IASB is responsible for writing, reviewing and issuing IFRS.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>IFRS comprise the IFRSs themselves that had been issued by IASB, the IASs issued by IASC and the interpretations issued by IFRIC.</p>
<p>Both the IASB and the IASC were formed by the IASCF to develop a set of uniform accounting standards that could be adopted globally. The IASC was formed in 1973 and was eventually replaced by the IASB after a restructuring in 2001.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>IFRS IC provides guidance and interpretations of the IFRSs.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> C.</span></p>
<p>Prudence relates to fairly estimating the assets and liabilities. However, it is neither understating nor overstating the assets and liabilities.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>Comparability does not stop an entity from changing its accounting policies, if the change is necessary and allowed by the accounting standards. Presenting two years&#x2019; financial information makes the financial statements comparable.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 6</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> A.</span></p>
<p>Consistency is preparing the financial statements in the same manner year after year. However the method can be changed if the new method is more appropriate or a new accounting standard prescribes it or it is necessary because of changes in the entity&#x2019;s operations.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 7</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> C.</span></p>
<p>The main purpose of the financial statement is to portray the financial position and performance of the entity and thus to satisfy the information needs of the stakeholders.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 8</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>As the name itself suggests, a bank loan is a liability. All other items are assets.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 9</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> A.</span></p>
<p>Interest received is income. Share capital will be included in equity; salaries and wages to the employees are expenses of the business. While cash has been received in exchange of an asset; the income in this transaction would be the amount received over the fair value (value) of the asset. This amount would be known as gain on sale of asset.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 10</span></p>
<p>The correct answer is<span class="bold"> D.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 11</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> B.</span></p>
<p>Appendix A of IFRS 1 defines deemed cost as &#x201C;An amount used as a surrogate for cost or depreciated cost at a given date. Subsequent depreciation or amortisation assumes that the entity had initially recognised the asset or liability at the given date and that its cost was equal to the deemed cost.&#x201D;</p>
