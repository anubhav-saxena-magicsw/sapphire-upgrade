<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. The nature of defined contribution, multi-employers and defined benefits schemes.</span><a href="videos/Employee Benefits Part 1.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>Post-employment benefits are employee benefits payable after the completion of employment.</p>
<p>They include retirement benefits, such as pensions, post-employment life insurance and post-employment medical care.</p>
<p>Arrangements whereby an entity provides post-employment benefits are known as post-employment benefit plans.</p>
<p>Post-employment benefit plans are either:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Defined contribution plans or</li>
<li>Defined benefit plans</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 What are defined contribution plans?</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity (a fund) and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employee benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Under a defined contribution plan the amount of liability of the entity towards post-retirement benefit is restricted to the fixed contributions to a separate entity or fund.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sunshine Ltd has a defined contribution plan with Frontline Insurance Co. According to the terms of the scheme, Sunshine Ltd has to pay a monthly fixed amount of $320 per employee per month to Frontline Insurance Co. Frontline Insurance will then invest this in assets which it hopes will increase the value of the overall plan in the future. The liability of Sunshine Ltd is still restricted to a fixed amount - $320 per month. This is a defined contribution scheme.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Furthermore, the amount of post-employment benefits received by the employee depends on the contributions paid by the entity and the employee (if any) to a post-employment benefit plan or to an insurance company, together with any investment returns arising from the contributions made.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing from the above example of Sunshine Ltd</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">After seven years of operation of the scheme, Mr. Rai retires. The amount of post-employment benefit received by Mr. Rai is related to the value of the fund created by the contributions made by Sunshine Ltd on his behalf, plus the returns on investments (if any) made by Frontline Insurance Co.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Therefore the actuarial risk and investment risks rest fully with the employee. There is no way to know how much the plan will ultimately give the employee upon retirement.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing from the above example</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The total amount received by Mr. Rai on retirement is dependent on the actual return on investments made by Frontline Insurance Co. If the insurance company has invested the money well, Mr Rai will get a good post-retirement benefit. Furthermore, the actual post-retirement benefit is known only after the date of retirement of Mr Rai. In addition, the risks of investment rest fully with Mr. Rai.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 What are defined benefit plans?</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Defined benefit plans </span>are post-employment benefit plans other than defined contribution plans.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Under defined benefit plans:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The entity&#x2019;s obligation is to provide the agreed benefits to current and former employees</li>
<li>Actuarial risk and investment risk fall, in substance, on the entity. If actuarial or investment experience is worse than expected, the entity&#x2019;s obligation may be increased.</li>
</ul>
<p>This basically means that employers agree to give their employees for example, a <span class="bold">defined benefit </span>when they retire e.g. a pension payable after they retire, of 50% of their final salary. The problem faced by employers is the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>How much should the employer pay into the pension fund to be sure that it can pay the employee 50% of their final salary?</li>
<li>How does the employer know how many of its employees will stay with them to retirement?</li>
<li>How does the employer know what the final salary of an employee could be?</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, there are many issues surrounding defined benefit plans! Now these issues must be solved and are answered below:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Generally, the amount of retirement benefits is calculated as a formula using:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The earnings of the employee and</li>
<li>The number of years of service of the employee</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Moonlight Ltd has a defined benefit plan, to offer post-retirement benefits to its employees. According to the arrangement, the amount of post-retirement benefit offered is $100 per month for each year of completed service. If Mr. Raj retires from Moonlight Ltd after 30 years of service, the pension payable to him would be $3,000 per month for his lifetime.</p>
<p class="boxpara">To ensure that the pre-determined amount is offered at the time of retirement, the amount of contribution Moonlight makes to the fund will not be fixed. It will change depending on the present value of the post-retirement benefit fund. Here the actual return on investments of the fund will have no bearing on the pension paid to Mr Raj. Even if the fund has received a poor return on its investments Moonlight Ltd will still be bound to pay the pre-determined amount to Mr. Raj. This will be done by Moonlight having to make additional contributions to the fund.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The amount of promised retirement benefits depend on:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The financial position of the plan (the value of the assets in the plan or fund)</li>
<li>Ability of contributors to make future contributions</li>
<li>Investment performance and efficiency of the plan</li>
</ul>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>The periodic advice of an actuary will be needed to assess the financial condition of the plan, review the assumptions and recommend future contribution levels.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Multi-employer plans</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Multi-employer plans are defined contribution plans (other than state plans) or defined benefit plans (other than state plans) that:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Pool the assets contributed by various entities that are not under common control.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Use those assets to provide benefits to employees of more than one entity, on the basis that contribution and benefit levels are determined without regard to the identity of the entity that employs the employees.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. The recognition and measurement of defined benefit schemes under current proposals.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Accounting for defined benefit plans by an entity involves the following steps:</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Accounting for DBP</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p186-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The above concepts and the methods followed for accounting for defined benefit plans are explained below:</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Determination of benefit for the current period and prior period</span></p>
<p class="block">According to the standard, an entity shall <span class="bold">attribute benefit to periods of service </span>under the plan&#x2019;s benefit formula i.e. the amount of pension which is payable on retirement needs to be attributed to each financial period until the time when the obligation materialises.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Saturn Ltd has a defined benefit plan for its employees. According to the plan, a lump sum of $2,500 is payable on retirement for each year of service. The benefit of $2,500 is attributable to each year of service. That means, for an employee completing 15 years of service in the entity, benefit payable is $37,500 ($2,500 x 15).</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Actuarial assumptions</span></p>
<p>Actuarial assumptions are an <span class="bold">entity&#x2019;s best estimates of the variables that will determine the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits. </span>They are made up of demographic assumptions and financial assumptions</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>Demographic assumptions </span>relate to the future characteristics of current and former employees. They deal with assumptions relating to:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Mortality, both during and after employment</li>
<li>Rates of employee turnover, disability and early retirement</li>
<li>The proportion of plan members with dependants who will be eligible for benefits</li>
<li>Claim rates under medical plans</li>
</ul>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Financial assumptions relate to:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The discount rate</li>
<li>Future salary and benefit levels</li>
<li>In the case of medical benefits, future medical costs, including, where material, the cost of administering claims and benefit payments</li>
<li>The expected rate of return on plan assets</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of the above factors will have an effect on the pension payable, so these factors need to be considered so as to make an appropriate estimate.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Actuarial assumptions should be unbiased and mutually compatible.</li>
<li>Actuarial assumptions should be neither imprudent nor excessively conservative. Only then will the assumptions be unbiased.</li>
<li>Actuarial assumptions need to reflect the economic relationships between factors such as inflation, rates of salary increase, the return on plan assets and discount rates. Only then will the actuarial assumptions be mutually compatible e.g. all assumptions depending on a particular inflation level (such as interest rates, salary etc.) in any given future period, should have the same inflation level for that period.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Moti Ltd has a defined benefit obligation plan for its employees. While determining the present value of the obligation it will consider the effect of inflation on the salary and thereby the amount of obligation will be determined.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Financial assumptions shall be based on market expectations, at the statement of financial position date, for the period over which the obligations are to be settled.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing from the above example</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Moti Ltd will make the financial assumptions e.g. discount rate on the basis of the market trends.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Determination of present value</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>The whole defined benefit obligation needs to be discounted, even if part of the obligation falls due within twelve months of the statement of financial position date.</span></p>
<p>An entity should determine the present value of defined benefit obligations and the fair value of any plan assets with sufficient regularity so that the amounts recognised in the financial statements do not differ materially from the amounts that would be determined at the statement of financial position date. Interest cost which is recognised each period is calculated by applying the <span class="bold">discount rate at the start </span>of the period <span class="bold">to the present value </span>of the defined benefit obligation at the <span class="bold">start of the period.</span></p>
<p>The discount rate is determined by taking into consideration the market yields at the end of the reporting period on high quality corporate bonds. In case there is no deep market available for such bonds, the market yields on government bonds are considered.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity&#x2019;s defined benefit liability on 31 December 2006 and 2007 is measured as follows:</p>

</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Projected unit credit method to discount the benefit to the present value</span></p>
<p>An entity <span class="bold">shall use the projected unit credit method </span>to determine the present value of its defined benefit obligations and the related current service cost and, where applicable, past service cost.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">Some defined benefit plans require employees or third party to contribute to the cost of the plan. Earlier IAS 19 required that such contributions that are linked to service were generally deducted from the service costs of the <span class="bold">period in which they were received.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">With the amendments of November 2013, IASB has clarified that if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, an entity is permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the service is rendered.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Examples of contributions that are independent of the number of years of service include those that are a fixed percentage of the employee&#x2019;s salary, a fixed amount throughout the service period or dependent on the employee&#x2019;s age.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Plan Assets</span><a href="videos/Employee Benefits Part 2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>In order to discharge the obligation under the defined benefit plan, the contribution by the employer/employees is invested in some plans, which are called plan assets.</p>
<p>An employer does not show these assets (the investments) in the financial statements as its assets, but deducts the fair value of the assets from the present value of the obligation, and the net deficit or surplus is presented in the statement of financial position.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Measurement of plan assets</span></p>
<p>Plan assets are to be measured at <span class="bold">fair value.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.5 Net interest</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) is the change during the period in the net defined benefit liability (asset) that arises from the passage of time.</p>
</div>
<p>Net interest means the interest expense\income calculated on the net defined benefit liability / asset. The net interest is calculated by multiplying the discount rate used to measure defined benefit liability with the net defined benefit liability or asset, as the case may be.</p>
<p>Thus, net interest leads to interest expense in case of net defined benefit liability, and interest income if there is a net defined benefit asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 1 January 2012, the opening balance of net defined benefit liability in the books of ABC Inc is $2,000. On 1 January 2011, the opening balance was a net defined benefit asset of $1,000. The discount rate used to measure the defined benefit liability is 10%.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, the net interest for the current year will be 10% of $2,000, i.e. $200. As it&#x2019;s a net defined benefit liability, an interest expense of $200 will arise. For the previous year, an interest income of 10% of $1,000 i.e. $100 would have to be recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<p>The net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset) can be disaggregated into:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>interest cost on the defined benefit obligation;</li>
<li>interest income on plan assets; and</li>
<li>interest on the effect of the asset ceiling.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refer to the example of Prestige Ltd given in paragraph 2.6 to understand the above disaggregation.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.6 Remeasurements</span></p>
<p>The concept of remeasurement is a new concept introduced by IAS 19 that was issued in June 2011. Remeasurements of net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>actuarial gains and losses on the defined benefit obligation;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefits liability (asset); and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>any change in the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability (asset).</p>
<p>Note - the asset ceiling is the present value of any economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Methods for recognition of remeasurement</span></p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19R, actuarial gains or losses are now a part of re-measurements. Earlier, IAS 19 provided three options to defer the actuarial gains or losses using the corridor method, either to the:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>profit or loss part of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or</li>
<li>OCI part of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or</li>
<li>entirely to the profit or loss part</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">The amended standard does not provide any option to recognise actuarial losses or gains in profit or loss. </span>Effects of remeasurements are recognised in other comprehensive income and they cannot be recycled through profit or loss in the subsequent periods. Thus, the only treatment for remeasurements is to recognise them in other comprehensive income.</p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 19R, the changes in the effect of the asset ceiling are presented both in profit or loss within net interest (for the interest effect on the asset ceiling) and in other comprehensive income as part of remeasurements for the remainder.</p>
<p>Asset ceiling is a ceiling or threshold which is placed to ensure that the entity does not recognise a surplus, i.e. net assets, over this particular limit, thus ensuring that the entity does not recognise any savings (net defined benefit asset), from defined benefit plans in excess of this ceiling.</p>
<p>Refer to the example below to understand this better.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Prestige Ltd provides introduced a pension plan for its employees. Prestige accounts for the plan in accordance with defined benefit plan. The amounts recognised in respect of that plan in Prestige&#x2019;s financial statements as at 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2011 and their reconciliation are set out below. Prestige Ltd has determined that the ceiling on recognising a net defined benefit asset in relation to the plan is $150,000 at both the start and end of the period.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p191-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Under the revised IAS 19, Prestige Ltd will recognise a net interest income of $15,000 in profit and loss. The remeasurements of $60,000 would be recognised in the other comprehensive income.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.7 Defined benefit liability (asset)</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The net defined benefit liability (asset) is the deficit or surplus, adjusted for any effect of limiting a net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling.</p>

</div>
<p>IAS 19 requires that net defined benefit liability (asset) is to be recognised in the statement of financial position. The net defined benefit asset or liability is equal to the amount owed to or from a plan. The term is similar to receivables or payables used normally.<br/>
Net defined benefit liability (asset) comprises:</p>

<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>any effect of limiting net defined benefit asset to the asset ceiling.</p>
<p>IAS 19R requires entities to recognise all changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) in the period in which those changes occur, and to disaggregate and recognise defined benefit cost as follows:</p>

<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">Some defined benefit plans require employees or third party to contribute to the cost of the plan. Earlier IAS 19 required that such contributions that are linked to service were generally deducted from the service costs of the <span class="bold">period in which they were received.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">With the amendments of November 2013, IASB has clarified that if the amount of the contributions is independent of the number of years of service, an entity is permitted to recognise such contributions as a reduction in the service cost in the period in which the service is rendered.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Examples of contributions that are independent of the number of years of service include those that are a fixed percentage of the employee&#x2019;s salary, a fixed amount throughout the service period or dependent on the employee&#x2019;s age.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.8 Determination of past service cost where a plan has been introduced or changed</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Past service cost</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Past service cost, is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods, resulting from a plan amendment (the introduction or withdrawal of, or changes to, a defined benefit plan) or a curtailment (a significant reduction by the entity in the number of employees covered by a plan).</p>
</div>
<p>Thus, past service cost occurs either due to an introduction or a change to a post-employment benefits plan. It is the change in the present value of the defined benefit obligation for employee service in prior periods. It may either be positive or negative, i.e. it may either increase or decrease the present value of the defined benefit obligation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An enterprise operates a pension plan that provides a pension of 1.5% of final salary for each year of service. The benefits become vested (are given) after seven years of service. On 1 January 2006 the enterprise improves the pension to 2% of final salary for each year of service starting from 1 January 1999.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case there is a change to a post-employment benefit plan i.e. from 1.5% to 2%.This additional 0.5% is payable for the past period also. Therefore the past service cost occurs.</p>
