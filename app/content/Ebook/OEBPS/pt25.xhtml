<p>In the last three Study Guides we have seen how to consolidate accounts of a parent company and its subsidiaries. What happens if the reporting company has less than 50% of the voting rights of another entity? Is it alright to treat it as an ordinary investment or is there any other treatment for such investments? </p>
<p>Let us consider the following case &#x2013; In the financial year 2005 - 06 Nandi Co owned a 55% share in Mandi Co. As Mandi Co was its subsidiary, its accounts were included in the consolidated financial statements. </p>
<p>In the financial year 2006 &#x2013; 07 Nandi Co sold some of its shares in Mandi Co and now it holds only 45% of the shares of Mandi Co. Mandi Co is no longer a subsidiary of Nandi Co. So should Nandi Co show its investment in Mandi Co as an ordinary investment? Can Nandi Co still control Mandi Co? </p>
<p>A 45% share is no small amount. Although Nandi Co would no longer be able to dictate terms, it would still be able to significantly influence the functioning and management of Mandi Co. Then how should Nandi Co treat Mandi Co? Mandi Co is an associate of Nandi Co and the equity method will be used for consolidation of accounts. </p>
<p>This Study Guide discusses the technique of preparation of consolidated financial statements including a subsidiary and an associate or a joint venture. </p>
