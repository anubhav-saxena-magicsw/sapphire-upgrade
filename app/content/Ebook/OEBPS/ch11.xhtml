<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Tax expense </span>(tax income) is the aggregate amount included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in respect of current tax and deferred tax.</p>
</div>
<p>Tax expense or tax income is the amount that is deducted from or added to the accounting profits respectively in the profit or loss, in respect of <span class="bold">current and deferred tax.</span></p>
<p><img src="images/p198-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Current tax</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Current tax </span>is the amount of income taxes payable (recoverable) in respect of the taxable profit (tax loss) for a period.</p>
</div>
<p>The definition above shows that current tax:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>is actually <span class="bold">payable or receivable </span>(as opposed to <span class="bold">deferred taxation,</span> a matching accounting tool to reduce distortions, discussed in more detail later in this Study Guide).</li>
<li>is calculated on the taxable profit or tax loss for a period. Although it relates to the <span class="bold">current period,</span> any adjustments required to <span class="bold">prior period tax </span>also form part of current tax.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current taxes are to be <span class="bold">treated as an expense.</span> However, if the tax relates to <span class="bold">items that are credited or charged </span>directly <span class="bold">to equity, then this </span>current tax and deferred tax shall <span class="bold">also be charged or credited directly to equity.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity determines total tax payable at $50,000. $40,000 of the tax relates to business income and $10,000 relates to a receipt, which is credited directly to equity.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The tax expense of $40,000 will be reflected in the statement of profit or loss. The balance of $10,000 will be recorded directly under equity and not in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<p>If the tax <span class="bold">expense and the provision at the end of the year are greater </span>than the payment, the <span class="bold">shortfall in the payment will be disclosed as a current tax liability.</span></p>
<p>If the tax <span class="bold">expense and the provision at the end of the year are lower </span>than the payment, the <span class="bold">excess payment will be disclosed as a current tax asset.</span></p>
<p>Current tax liabilities or assets are measured:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>For current and prior periods.</li>
<li><span class="bold">At the amount expected to be paid to or recovered from </span>the taxation authorities.</li>
<li><span class="bold">At the tax rates </span>or laws that have been <span class="bold">enacted or substantially enacted.</span></li>

<span class="bold">The effect of taxable temporary differences on accounting and taxable profits.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Principles of accounting for deferred tax</span></p>
<p>IAS 12 deals with taxes on income (current as well as deferred tax). Current tax is tax related to the current year whereas deferred tax is a matching accounting tool, used for taxes related to other than current year.</p>
<p>Recognition of deferred tax is based on the principle that when an asset or liability is recognised, it is obvious that the entity will recover or settle the carrying amount of that asset or liability. If as a result of such recovery or settlement of the carrying amount, future tax payments get affected, IAS 12 requires that in order to ensure the matching principle, the entity should recognise a deferred tax liability / deferred tax asset when the related asset or liability is recognised.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Polo Plc has a building with carrying value of $200,000. The current tax rate is 20%. The entity decides to revalue the building to a fair value of $500,000. Now, by doing so, the entity is recognising that in the future it is likely to be able to sell the asset for $500,000. It is also likely to have to pay tax on this sale. If Polo knows that it will have to pay this additional tax later on, then it should account for it in some manner. Therefore deferred tax on $300,000 ($500,000 - $200,000) should be recognised in the current year.</p>
</div>
<p>Some items are recognised in the statement of financial position at a time different from the time when they are considered for taxation, giving rise to temporary difference. Such as, in some countries, statutory payments payable are allowed for tax purpose only in the year when they are paid.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Gile Plc recognised a sales tax of $20,000 payable in 20X7 but it was paid in 20X8. For accounting purposes, it will be deducted from the profits of 20X7; however, for taxation purposes it is deductible in 20X8. Therefore this will give rise to a temporary difference (i.e. reversible in future) of $20,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Temporary difference</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">Temporary differences </span>are differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and its tax base.</li>
<li>The <span class="bold">tax base </span>of an asset or liability is the amount attributed to that asset or liability for tax purposes.</li>
<li><span class="bold">Taxable profit (tax loss) </span>is the profit (loss) for a period, determined in accordance with the rules established by the taxation authorities, upon which income taxes are payable (recoverable).</li>
<li><span class="bold">Accounting profit </span>is profit or loss for a period before deducting tax expense.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The carrying amount is the amount appearing in the statement of financial position. The concept of tax base is discussed below.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements may be different from the related &#x2018;tax bases&#x2019; for a temporary period. In the future, depending upon the tax laws, such differences would be eliminated. These differences are called temporary differences.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The cost of an asset is $100,000. For the first year, the accounting depreciation is $16,000 whereas the depreciation according to tax laws is $25,000. The carrying value of the asset is $84,000 ($100,000 - $16,000) and tax base is $75,000 ($100,000 - $25,000).</p>
<p class="boxpara">Assuming that the asset will be written down to zero both for accounts and tax purposes, this difference will be reversed in the future, (0 &#x2013; 0) i.e. it is temporary. Therefore temporary difference is $9,000 ($25,000 - $16,000) i.e. difference between carrying amount and tax base of the asset.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Peanut Co incurred development costs during the year and recognised them as an intangible asset. They are to be amortised in the accounts over 10 years. However, for tax purposes, they are deducted fully when incurred. Since the timing of recognition is different, it gives rise to temporary difference.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Permanent differences (Zero temporary difference)</span></p>
<p>Many local GAAPs use the term permanent difference when the difference in the carrying amount and tax base does not get eliminated in the future. However the term is not used in IAS 12 Income Taxes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Big Co has paid a penalty of $8,000 which is treated as an expense for accounting profits. However, according to the local laws, a penalty is not a deductible expense when calculating tax profit and therefore there is a difference between the accounting and tax profits which will not be reversed in the future. This is a permanent difference.</p>
</div>
<p>Temporary difference is for a temporary period and gets reversed in the future.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>As a principle, remember that if the entity expects to recover the carrying amount of an asset or settle the carrying amount of a liability without affecting taxable profit, no deferred tax arises in respect of the asset or liability. In that case, carrying amount = tax base.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 How to calculate tax base</span></p>
<p>The tax base of an asset or liability is the <span class="bold">amount attributed to it for tax purposes.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>For assets</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">When economic benefits are taxable</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>In the case of expenses, the <span class="bold">tax base </span>is the amount that will be <span class="bold">deductible for tax purposes </span>from the taxable economic benefits flowing to the entity when it recovers the carrying amount of an asset.</p>
<p>The carrying amount of an asset can be recovered by using the asset or selling it.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p201-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>In the case of income, the <span class="bold">tax base </span>is the amount that will <span class="bold">NOT </span>be <span class="bold">taxable in future </span>when the carrying amount of an asset is recovered.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p201-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">When economic benefits are not taxable</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>If the economic benefits are <span class="bold">not taxable in future,</span> the tax base of the asset is equal to its carrying amount.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p201-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>For liabilities</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span><span class="bold">Expenses: </span>the tax base is the <span class="bold">carrying amount </span>of the liability <span class="bold">less </span>the <span class="bold">amount deductible for tax purposes </span>against that liability <span class="bold">in future.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A current liability with a carrying value of $50,000 that is <span class="bold">allowable fully </span>under tax laws as a deduction on a payment basis. The tax base in this case will be nil (the carrying amount $50,000 amount deductible in future $50,000).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span><span class="bold">Income received in advance: </span>the tax base will be the carrying amount, less any amount of revenue that will <span class="bold">not be taxable </span>against that item in future.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rent received in advance of $5,000 has already been taxed on a receipts basis under local tax law (i.e. tax has already been paid). Therefore, the full amount will not be taxed again in future. Therefore the tax base is nil (the carrying amount $5,000 the amount not taxable $5,000).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Items not recognised as an asset or liability</span></p>
<p>Some items are not recognised as assets or liabilities, but may still have a tax base.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Delta Co has incurred research costs of $50,000 during the year. This amount is charged to the statement of profit or loss for accounting purpose. For tax purpose the deduction is permitted only after satisfying certain conditions and only to the extent of $30,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, no asset or liability will be recognised therefore carrying amount will be nil and the amount deductible in future i.e. $30,000 will be the tax base.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Types of temporary differences</span></p>
<p>Temporary differences may be of two types:</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Taxable temporary differences </span>are temporary differences that will result in <span class="bold">taxable amounts </span>in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Deductible temporary differences </span>are temporary differences that will result in <span class="bold">amounts that are deductible </span>in determining taxable profit (tax loss) of future periods when the carrying amount of the asset or liability is recovered or settled.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Taxable temporary differences (TTD)</span></p>
<p>These are the temporary differences that result in lower taxable profits than accounting profits in the current or earlier periods. Being temporary, they will reverse in the future. On reversal, in future, taxable profits will be higher than accounting profits.</p>
<p>Since the TTD are subject to <span class="bold">tax in the future </span>they are called as <span class="bold">taxable differences.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Assets</span></p>
<p>For assets, a taxable temporary difference occurs when depreciation or amortisation is accelerated for tax purposes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The cost of an asset is $100,000. For the first year, accounting depreciation is $16,000 while tax depreciation is $25,000. The accounting profit will be $9,000 ($25,000 &#x2013; 16,000) higher than taxable profit.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The carrying amount of an asset is $84,000. <span class="bold">In future,</span> the entity will <span class="bold">earn taxable income and recover this carrying amount. </span>When it does so, for tax purposes it can deduct only $75,000 ($100,000 &#x2013; $25,000), the tax base, on which depreciation is yet to be allowed. On the difference of $9,000, it will have to pay tax, i.e. it is a taxable difference.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Liabilities</span></p>
<p>If a particular liability has already been allowed as a deduction for tax purposes but has not been deducted in the accounts, a taxable temporary difference occurs.</p>
<p>This situation is seen less frequently in real life.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the Accounting records, the development expenses are amortised over the useful economic life of the intangible asset.</p>
<p class="boxpara">For tax purposes, the development costs are deducted fully when incurred.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In later years, when the accounts show expenditure by way of amortisation, the expenditure will not be allowed again for tax purposes. As a result, taxable profit will be more in future and therefore this is a temporary taxable difference.</p>
</div>
<p>An entity records a loan at the proceeds received, net of transaction costs. The transaction costs are deducted in the first period to calculate taxable profits. They are amortised gradually in accounts, thereby increasing the carrying amount of the loan.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.5 Deductible temporary differences</span></p>
<p>This situation is the <span class="bold">reverse of taxable temporary differences. </span>Taxable temporary differences result in higher taxable profits in future whereas deductible temporary differences result in lower taxable profits in future.</p>
<p>In other words, these differences are <span class="bold">deductible in future </span>for taxation purpose therefore <span class="bold">deductible differences.</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Determination of deferred tax asset and liability</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/p203-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company had accrued product warranty costs of $10,000 in its accounts, in respect of claims made by customers against warranties. The taxation laws do not permit the deduction until the company actually pays the claims.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Its taxable profits for the current period will be higher by $10,000. In future, it will be lower.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, this is <span class="bold">a deductible difference.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.6 Fair value adjustments, revaluations and impairments</span></p>
<p>The IFRS permits or requires certain assets to be carried at fair values or revalued amounts. This means changing the carrying amounts of the assets in the accounts. Depending upon the local tax laws, the tax base of these assets may or may not be adjusted by the equivalent amount.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity revalues property, plant and equipment (under the revaluation model recommended in IAS 16) in the accounts, increasing the carrying value from $50,000 to $60,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, local tax laws state that the value of the property for tax purposes remains at historical cost.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This means the tax base remains $50,000.</p>
</div>
<p>When fair value adjustments are made to the financial assets or investment property where the carrying amount is different from carrying value, no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes.</p>
<p>The loss will be recognised on sale of investments for tax purposes and the tax profit on sale will be lower than the accounting profit. Therefore, a temporary difference would arise when such a fair value adjustment is made.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Donald Co has an investment costing $10,000 which it carries at fair value. On 31 December 20X8, the fair value of the investment is $8,000. For accounting purpose, $2,000 will be charged to the statement of profit or loss immediately and accordingly the accounting profit will reduce.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, for tax purpose, $2,000 will not be allowed as a deduction in the same year but will be allowed in the next year when the investment is sold for $8,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This means in 20X8, the tax base ($10,000) of the investment was more than the carrying amount ($8,000) by $2,000 which will be reversed in 20X9, on sale. Therefore $2,000 should be considered a deductible temporary difference.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.7 Deferred tax on Impairment</span></p>
<p>If the net realisable value of inventory or the recoverable amount of property, plant and equipment falls below the previous carrying amount, the entity reduces the carrying amount. These adjustments are ignored for tax purposes until the asset is sold. As a result, temporary difference will arise until the carrying value is realised.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. The requirements relating to deferred tax assets and liabilities.<br/> Calculate and record deferred tax amounts in the financial statements.</span></p>
<p>The temporary difference gives rise to recognition of deferred tax asset / liability depending on whether the difference is deductible or taxable.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Deferred tax liabilities are the amounts of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Deferred tax assets are the amounts of income taxes recoverable in future periods in respect of:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Deductible temporary differences</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The carry forward of unused tax losses</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">3. </span>The carry forward of unused tax credits</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Deferred tax liabilities / assets</span></p>
<p>As the above definition indicates, deferred tax liabilities are closely related to taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are linked to deductible temporary differences. In fact, <span class="bold">all taxable temporary differences except in those stated in the next paragraph) give rise to deferred tax liabilities and all </span>deductible temporary differences (except those stated in the next paragraph) give rise to deferred tax assets.</p>
<p><img src="images/p205-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This means that deferred tax accounting is required when the identifiable assets acquired (excluding goodwill) and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognised at their fair values in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes.</p>
<p>However, a deferred tax asset (DTA) shall be recognised for all deductible temporary differences <span class="bold">to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary difference can be utilised.</span></p>
<p>IAS 12 does not permit the recognition of the deferred tax liability resulting from the initial recognition of goodwill because goodwill is measured as a residual and the recognition of the deferred tax liability would increase the carrying amount of goodwill.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Tip Co acquired Top Co for $5m. The fair value of net assets of Top on the acquisition date was $3m. Therefore goodwill of $2m is recognised in the business combination. Since goodwill is an asset acquired as a result of acquisition and the tax authorities do not allow reduction in goodwill as a deductible expense while determining taxable profits, deferred tax liability (DTL) may be required to be recognised.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, IFRS 3 prohibits recognition of DTL against such goodwill as goodwill itself is a residual amount (i.e. balance after allocating consideration to the fair values of net assets of a subsidiary.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Measurement shall be <span class="bold">at the tax rates expected to apply </span>to the period when the asset is realised or liability is settled.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The rates used shall be those <span class="bold">enacted or substantially enacted by the end of the reporting period.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>Measurement <span class="bold">depends upon the expectations about the manner </span>in which the recovery of tax asset or settlement of tax liability will take place.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Straw co has an asset with a carrying amount of $100,000 and tax base of $60,000. According to the local laws, a tax rate of 20% is applicable to receipt (e.g. arising from sale of assets) and 30% is applicable to other income.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, the company would require recognition of a deferred tax liability. However the rate to be used depends upon the manner in which management wishes to recover the carrying value of the asset. This means that if management decides to sell the asset, the deferred tax liability will be $8,000 ($40,000 x 20%). On the other hand, if management wishes to recover the amount by using the asset, the amount of liability will be $12,000 ($40,000 x 30%).</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>Normally, if an asset or liability to be realised / settled in future is recognised today, its discounted value should be considered. <span class="bold">However, in the case of deferred tax assets and liabilities, IAS 12 specifically lays down that the values are not to be discounted.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">A deferred tax asset is recognised,</span> giving rise to a corresponding effect of deferred tax income. This deferred tax income will nullify the extra amount in the current tax expense. In future, when the related profit is recognised, this deferred tax asset should be transferred to expense.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Recognition of current and deferred tax</span></p>
<p>The recognition provision for current tax is also applicable to deferred tax.</p>
<p>The amount is to be recognised in Profit or Loss. However, in the following cases, it should not be recognised in Profit or Loss.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Current tax and deferred tax that relates to items that are recognised, in the same or a different period in other comprehensive income, shall be recognised in other comprehensive income.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Revaluation gains on property and exchange differences arising on the translation of the financial statements of a foreign operation are presented in the &#x2018;other comprehensive income&#x2019; section of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. Tax related to these items is also recognized in the same section of statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Current tax and deferred tax that relates to items that are recognised, in the same or a different period directly in equity, shall be recognised directly in equity.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">When there is a change in accounting policy that is applied retrospectively or the correction of an error, an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is made. Similarly, on initial recognition of a compound financial instrument, a part of the amount is recognized in equity.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The tax effects of these items are also recognized directly in equity.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Deferred tax liability / asset for a Business combination</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">On initial recognition of assets and liabilities</span></p>
<p>As stated above, deferred tax accounting is required when the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are recognised at their fair values in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes. Such resulting deferred tax assets (to the extent that they meet the recognition criteria) or deferred tax liabilities as a result of business combination should be recognised as identifiable assets and liabilities at the acquisition date. This affects the net assets taken over and therefore, the goodwill or gain on bargain purchase amount.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alpha Co acquired 100% share capital of Beta Co on 1 January 2009. The carrying amount and fair value of assets as on the date of acquisition was as follows:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/p208-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Fair values of the assets and liability as on the acquisition date are more by $25,000.This gives rise to deferred tax as for income tax purposes the values will remain $160,000.Since carrying values are more by $25,000, a deferred tax liability will be recognised on acquisition.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Assuming the tax rate to be 20%, deferred tax liability will be $5,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">Intra group transactions</span></p>
<p>Deferred tax liability / asset arises when unrealised losses / profits resulting from intra group transactions are eliminated from the carrying amount of assets, such as inventory or property, plant or equipment, but no equivalent adjustment is made for tax purposes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The parent company sold an inventory costing $1m after adding a profit of $0.10m to the subsidiary, which held the inventory at the reporting date. This unrealised profit will be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, tax authorities would not make such adjustments. This creates a deductible difference. Assuming the tax rate as 30%, a deferred tax asset of $30,000 (100,000 x 30%) is created.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.4 Deferred tax assets against unused tax losses and unused credits</span></p>
<p>In addition to the deductible temporary differences, deferred tax assets may also be recognised, for the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the carry forward of unused tax losses and</li>
<li>the carry forward of unused tax credits</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">The DTA should be recognised only to the extent it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which </span>the above losses or credits can be utilised.</p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct entries are <span class="bold">A </span>and <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>Tax base of the asset is: Cost 60,000 &#x2013; Tax depreciation 30,000 = $30,000.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Tax base = Nil</p>
<p>Closing value of liability (advance rent) = $32,000</p>
<p>$32,000 x 25% tax rate = $8,000 DTA</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Carrying value = $15 million - $6 million = $9 million</p>
<p>Tax base = $15 million - $12 million = $3 million.</p>
<p>Temporary difference = $9 million - $3 million = $6 million.</p>
<p>Since the carrying value of the asset is greater than tax base. We recognise a deferred tax liability.</p>
<p>Therefore, Deferred tax liability is 15% of $6 million = $0.9 million</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>Tax base = Nil</p>
<p>Closing value of warranty liability = $10 million</p>
<p>Since Liability &gt; Tax base, <span class="bold">deferred tax asset </span>will be calculated as:</p>
<p>$10 million x 15% tax rate = $1.5 million</p>
