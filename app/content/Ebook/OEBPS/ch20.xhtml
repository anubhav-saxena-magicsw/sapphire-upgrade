<p>The International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) Framework specifies the four <span class="bold">qualitative characteristics </span>of financial statements and &#x201C;comparability&#x201D; is one of them.</p>
<p>It is important for the users of the financial statements to compare the financial statements of different entities with regard to financial performance, financial position and changes in the financial position.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 What are accounting policies?</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Accounting policies </span>are the <span class="bold">specific principles, bases, conventions, rules and practices </span>applied by an entity in preparing and presenting financial statements.</p>
</div>
<p>While preparing financial statements there are many areas which can be accounted for differently. For example, inventory can be valued using different methods such as FIFO, average cost (AVCO) etc. An entity has to select the one most appropriate method and apply it consistently. IAS 2 does not permit the use of LIFO as a cost formula to measure inventory.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Selection and application of accounting policies</span></p>
<p>While selecting accounting policies an entity should use the following criteria:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>For transactions, other events or conditions (which will have a material effect on the financial statements) on which guidance from either the IFRS Standard or Interpretation is available, the accounting policy to be applied would be based on the available guidance from the IFRS. However, these policies need not be applied when the effect of applying them is not material.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>In the absence of an IFRS that specifically applies to a transaction, other event or condition, management should use its judgement in developing and applying an accounting policy that results in information that is:</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">i </span>relevant </span>to the economic decision-making needs of users ; and</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">ii </span>reliable, </span>in that the financial statements:</p>
<p class="hang1aa"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> faithfully represent the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity;</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> reflect the economic substance of transactions, other events and conditions, and not merely the legal form;</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> are neutral, i.e. free from bias;</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> are prudent; and</p>
<p class="hang1a"><img src="images/arr.png" alt=""/> are complete in all material respects.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Consistent application of accounting policies</span></p>
<p>According to Para 13 of IAS 8, an entity shall <span class="bold">select and apply its accounting policies consistently </span>for <span class="bold">similar transactions,</span> other events and conditions, <span class="bold">unless </span>a standard or an interpretation specifically requires <span class="bold">or permits categorisation </span>of items for which <span class="bold">different policies </span>may be appropriate. If a standard or an interpretation requires or permits such categorisation, an appropriate accounting policy shall be selected and applied consistently to each category.</p>
<p>The application of the same accounting policies within each period and from one period to the next allows the users of financial statements to compare the financial statements of the entity year after year and study the trends in financial position.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Changes in accounting policies</span></p>
<p>A change in accounting policy means <span class="bold">changing a method used </span>for preparing and presenting a part of a financial statement from the one which was adopted previously.</p>
<p>Changes to accounting policies are permitted only under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The change is required by a standard or interpretation.</li>
<li>The change will result in greater accuracy of the financial statements, and therefore increases the understanding of the financial statements.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">A change in accounting policy to meet the requirement of an accounting standard can occur in the following situations:</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>When a <span class="bold">new accounting standard </span>or interpretation is <span class="bold">introduced </span>for certain transactions or events.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">IAS International Accounting Standard 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance was introduced on 1 January 1984. Therefore entities which had transactions covered under this accounting standard prior to January 1984, might have had a different accounting policy.</p>
<p class="boxpara">With the introduction of this accounting standard the entities would be bound to adopt accounting policies in accordance with the accounting standard.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>When the <span class="bold">available accounting standard is revised </span>for certain transactions or events.</p>
<p><span class="bold">A change in accounting policies </span>is made when the change <span class="bold">results in more reliable financial statements</span></p>
<p>which result in more relevant information.</p>
<p>These changes are called <span class="bold">voluntary changes </span>in accounting policies. Entities are allowed to change their accounting policies voluntarily, provided:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>they are in a position to justify how the change in the accounting policy would make the financial statements more reliable.</li>
<li>the changed accounting policy does not lead to non-compliance with any relevant accounting standard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some examples of voluntary changes made to accounting policies are as follows:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Change in accounting policy for inventory valuation from FIFO to weighted average cost</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>Change in depreciation policy from cost method to revelation model</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>Changing from writing off to capitalising interest relating to construction of non-current assets</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.5 The following items are not treated as a change in accounting policy</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The application of an accounting policy for transactions, other events, or conditions that differ in substance from those occurred previously.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">ICC Ltd manufactured bags until 2008. It had 5 motor vehicles at that time which were used for the delivery of bags. ICC Ltd classified all these motor vehicles as non-current assets in 2008.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, in 2009 shareholders have approved a proposal for a change in the nature of the business from manufacturer of bags to sale of used motor vehicles. ICC Ltd classified all the existing 5 vehicles as current assets (not non-current assets) during 2009 as they will be sold as part of normal business.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This change in classification will not be treated as a change in accounting policy.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The application of a new accounting policy for transactions, other events, or conditions, which did not occur in the past or which were not material.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">If Healthcare Foundation obtains a government grant for the first time in 2009, this grant will be dealt with in the financial books under International Accounting Standard 20 Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This is a transaction which was not in existence in earlier years. Therefore it cannot be treated as a change in accounting policy.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Prior period adjustments and &#x2018;errors&#x2019; and account for the correction of errors and changes in accounting policies.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Prior period errors</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Depending on the time </span>of occurrence, <span class="bold">errors are of two types:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Errors <span class="bold">committed </span>and <span class="bold">discovered in </span>the <span class="bold">current </span>year</li>
<li>Errors <span class="bold">committed earlier </span>but <span class="bold">discovered in </span>the <span class="bold">current </span>year; also known as <span class="bold">prior period errors</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Prior period errors </span>are <span class="bold">omissions </span>from, and <span class="bold">misstatements </span>in, the entity&#x2019;s financial statements for one or more <span class="bold">prior periods </span>arising from a <span class="bold">failure </span>to <span class="bold">use, or misuse of, reliable information </span>that:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>was <span class="bold">available </span>when financial statements for those periods were authorised for issue.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>could <span class="bold">reasonably </span>be <span class="bold">expected </span>to have been <span class="bold">obtaine</span>d and <span class="bold">taken into account </span>in the preparation and presentation of those financial statements.</p>
</div>
<p>Errors include the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in applying accounting policies, oversights or misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sunshine Enterprises prepares its financial statements by recording a purchase of a CNC machine during 2009, worth $50,000 under purchases instead of purchase of non-current assets and the error comes to light in the following accounting year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Considering the nature of the transaction and the value of the transaction, it is a <span class="bold">material </span>transaction. Also the company had <span class="bold">information </span>when the financial statements for 2009 were <span class="bold">authorised </span>and could <span class="bold">reasonably be expected to have considered the transaction </span>and taken it into account while preparing the financial statements during 2009. Therefore this is a prior period error.</p>
</div>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p><span class="bold">Omissions </span>or <span class="bold">misstatements </span>of items are <span class="bold">MATERIAL </span>if they could, <span class="bold">individually </span>or <span class="bold">collectively</span>; <span class="bold">influence </span>the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements. Materiality depends on the <span class="bold">size </span>and <span class="bold">nature of the omission </span>or misstatement judged in the surrounding circumstances. The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Prior period adjustments</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Prior period adjustments are adjustments which:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>relate to a prior period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>are made due to correction of an error or change in accounting policy</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>have a material impact on the financial statements.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Prior period adjustments do not apply to transactions, which are accounted for based on estimates.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rose International is preparing its financial statements as at 31 December 2009. Due to a change in the estimated life of the machinery, the company auditors decide to change the rate of depreciation from 10% to 15%. <span class="bold">This transaction does not qualify for a prior period adjustment.</span> This is because the change in the rate of depreciation is not a correction of an error or a change in the accounting policy. The determination of the rate of depreciation is based on &#x2018;estimates&#x2019;.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Accounting for correction of errors and changes in accounting policy</span></p>
<p>If material errors <span class="bold">committed earlier are discovered in the current year,</span> entities are required to rectify such errors or make changes to their accounting policies.</p>
<p><span class="bold">1. Accounting for correction of prior period errors</span></p>
<p>An entity shall correct material prior period errors <span class="bold">retrospectively in the first set of financial statements authorised for issue after their discovery </span>by:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span><span class="bold">restating </span>the <span class="bold">comparative amounts </span>for the prior period(s) presented in which the error occurred; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>if the <span class="bold">error occurred before the earliest prior period </span>presented, <span class="bold">restating the opening balances </span>of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest prior period presented.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Accounting for changes to accounting policies</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Application of changes to accounting policies</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/301-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>According to Para 22 of IAS 8, when a <span class="bold">change in accounting policy is applied retrospectively </span>in accordance with paragraph 19(a) or (b), the entity shall adjust the opening balance of each affected component of equity for the earliest prior period presented and the other comparative amounts disclosed for each prior period presented as if the new accounting policy had always been applied.</p>
<p>Therefore retrospective adjustment means that <span class="bold">adjustment of the opening balances </span>for each component of equity, and for each prior period, is made in such a way that a new accounting policy is applied.</p>
<p>Generally it is quite straightforward to apply the change in accounting policy retrospectively.</p>
<p>However, there are occasions when entities find it impracticable to determine the adjustments to be made on account of the change in the accounting policies.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">TIP</p>
<p>Application of a requirement is impracticable when the entity <span class="bold">cannot apply it after making every reasonable effort to do so.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Corrections to prior period errors or changes in accounting policy are made as follows:</span></p>
<p>The following diagram summarises the accounting treatment for the prior period errors as detailed in para 43, 44 and 45 of IAS 8.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Accounting for correction of errors</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/302-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The financial statements of Sunshine Enterprises for 2008, show inventory at $265,153. However, the inventory statement as at 31 December 2008, has erroneously excluded the valuation of inventory amounting to $85,222 which was lying with its sub-contractor. Hence it has undervalued its inventory. This came to light in 2009, after the financial statements were authorised. Here it is possible to make the correction retrospectively.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, the correction of the error in the financial statements would have to be made retrospectively from 2008.</p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>In the case of a change in accounting policy, in the current year, comparative figures of the previous year should be adjusted to reflect the change. If this is not possible, the opening balance of retained earnings should be adjusted as if the new policy had been applied since the beginning.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>A voluntary change in accounting policies can only be made if the new method provides reliable and more relevant information.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>The given transaction should neither be reported as an accounting change nor a correction of an error.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> C.</span></p>
<p>Other options relate to change in accounting estimates.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is<span class="bold"> A.</span></p>
<p>Changes in Accounting Estimates must be accounted for prospectively in the financial statements, i.e. the effects of the change must be incorporated in the accounting period in which the estimates are revised. Therefore, carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and any associated expense and gains are adjusted in the period of change in estimate</p>
