<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Initial measurement</span></p>
<p>The question of measurement arises only when we decide to recognise an asset. Hence, it is necessary to determine first whether and when the asset is to be recognised.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Recognition</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Para 7 of IAS 16 gives the following criteria:</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">&#x201C;</span>The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment should be <span class="bold">recognised as an asset if, and only if:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to the entity; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the cost of the item can be measured reliably.<span class="bold">&#x201D;</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Related issues</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Spare parts </span>and servicing equipment are usually <span class="bold">treated as inventory and recognised in profit or loss </span>as and when consumed.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Major </span>spare parts and standby equipment are <span class="bold">treated as property, plant and equipment when they are expected to be used over more than one period. </span>They are included in non-current assets from the<span class="bold"> date the cost is incurred.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">c) </span></span>Those which can be used <span class="bold">exclusively </span>with an item of property, plant and equipment are accounted for <span class="bold">as property, plant and equipment.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">d) </span></span>It is necessary to decide the unit of measurement for non-current assets to determine:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>whether a particular item qualifies for recognition; and</li>
<li>what value is to be taken.</li>
</ul>
<p>The IAS does not prescribe any unit. It is left to the <span class="bold">judgement </span>of management. It may be appropriate to <span class="bold">aggregate individually insignificant </span>items while applying the criteria.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Costs and measurement</span></p>
<p>It is necessary to understand the meaning and relationship of the concepts of <span class="bold">initial and subsequent costs, measurement at recognition, and measurement after recognition.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Costs </span>here refer to an <span class="bold">act of incurring expenditure </span>on the non-current assets.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement at recognition </span>refers to the <span class="bold">valuation </span>of the cost incurred (whether the cost is an initial cost or a subsequent cost).<span class="bold"></span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement after recognition </span>refers to the calculation of the <span class="bold">carrying value </span>in the <span class="bold">subsequent </span>financial statements. It is <span class="bold">not related to any accounting transaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Initial and subsequent costs</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Cost </span>is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of the other consideration given to acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of other IFRSs e.g. IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">On breaking down this definition, we can see that:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>cost is the amount paid to acquire the asset e.g. $500 to buy a table OR</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the value of anything else given in exchange for the asset e.g. a computer with the fair value of $500 was given in return for receiving a table OR</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>the valuation method given by other standards for something given in exchange for the asset e.g. share options worth $500 were given in return for receiving a table.</p>
<p>Tangible non-current assets are normally <span class="bold">used for more than one year.</span> An entity may incur costs on these when they are <span class="bold">acquired initially as well as subsequently,</span> to maintain the assets or to renovate or upgrade them. Therefore, the costs incurred on property, plant and equipment may be of two types.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Initial costs</span></p>
<p>These are the costs incurred initially <span class="bold">for bringing the asset to the location and in the condition necessary for its intended use </span>e.g. acquisition costs, construction costs, erection costs.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The purchase price of a machine is $110,000. Other costs are as follows: freight $2,000, import duty $5,000, installation expenses $1,000. These are all initial costs. The total initial cost is $118,000 (110,000 + 2,000 + 5,000 + 1,000).</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Elements and measurement of costs</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement at recognition</span><a href="videos/Property Plant and Equipment Part 2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>Based upon the principles discussed above, once it is decided that an item of the asset is to be recognised, the next question that arises is: <span class="bold">at what value?</span></p>
<p>IAS 16 gives the following guidance at Para 15:</p>
<p><span class="bold">&#x201C;</span>An item of property, plant and equipment that qualifies for recognition as an asset <span class="bold">should be measured at its cost.&#x201D;</span></p>
<p>Going one step further, now we need to know the <span class="bold">elements of cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The following are included in cost:</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Purchase price</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its location and in the condition so as to make it available for its intended use</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located</p>
<p>All of these are discussed in detail in the following sections:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Purchase price:</span> This is considered after deducting trade discounts and rebates and adding duties and non-refundable taxes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The total price paid for machinery is $110,000; this is the basic price of $100,000 plus Value Added Tax (VAT) of $10,000. The entity gets a credit of VAT paid on the machinery, while calculating the tax payable on the finished goods sold. Tax paid of $10,000 while purchasing the machinery will be treated as refundable and hence not included in the cost of machinery. The cost will simply be $100,000.</p>
</div>
<p>The price to be considered is the <span class="bold">cash price </span>equivalent <span class="bold">at the recognition date.</span> If the asset is acquired on <span class="bold">deferred credit </span>i.e. credit beyond the normal credit period, then the difference between the cash price and the total payment is treated as <span class="bold">interest </span>and recognised over the credit period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The total cost of a large computerised machine is $40,000. Butter Co do not have enough cash, so agree to pay for it a year later, however they will pay $45,000. $5,000 ($45,000 - $40,000) will be treated as interest payable and not included in the cost of the asset.</p>
</div>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">b) </span>Costs directly attributable </span>to bringing the asset to its <span class="bold">location and in the condition </span>so as to make it available for its intended use. Examples are as follows:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>Costs of employee benefits (as defined in IAS 19 Employee Benefits) arising from construction or acquisition of property, plant and equipment.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>Costs of preparing the site.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>Initial delivery and handling costs (e.g. freight).</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iv. </span>Installation costs (e.g. wages to install machinery).</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">v. </span>Testing costs net of revenue generated, such as sale proceeds of material produced during a test run (e.g. material and wages directly related to test production).</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">vi. </span>Professional fees (e.g. architects&#x2019; fees).</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">c) </span>Initial estimate of the costs of dismantling and removing </span>the item and restoring the site on which it is located. However, such cost can be recognised only if the obligation for dismantling and restoring the site is incurred either:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>when the item is acquired</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>as a consequence of having used the item during a particular period for purposes other than to produce inventories during that period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rohan Plc set up fire safety devices around its factory premises. The price paid for devices is $110,000 ($100,000 plus VAT of $10,000). The entity gets a credit of $10,000 while calculating the tax payable on the finished goods sold.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Additional costs are freight $2,000, import duty $5,000, installation expenses $1,000. The initial estimate of dismantling and removing the item is $3,000. After the machine was put to use, $1,500 was spent for maintenance. Calculate the initial cost of the asset and justify your reasons per IAS 16.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The cost should be computed as:</p>

<p class="boxpara">Maintenance charges of $1,500 are to be shown as an expense in the statement of profit or loss, and not as an asset.</p>
</div>
<p>It <span class="bold">follows </span>that after the asset is brought to the location and in condition, <span class="bold">recognition of the costs included in the carrying amount </span>(i.e. capitalisation) <span class="bold">ceases.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The following are NOT included in cost:</span></p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>Administration and general <span class="bold">overhead </span>costs e.g. rent of office.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span><span class="bold">Costs of launching </span>a new product or service e.g. advertising.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>Expenses on <span class="bold">opening a new business </span>facility or conducting business at a new place e.g. expenses of an inaugural function.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">iv. </span>Costs of <span class="bold">relocating </span>e.g. costs of shifting a factory consequent to a government order.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">v. </span><span class="bold">Initial </span>losses when the asset operates at a <span class="bold">low capacity; e.g. </span>a plant has a capacity of 1,000mt. Since initially it operates only at 400mt capacity, not enough gross profit is generated to cover fixed costs. Any loss arising cannot be added to the cost of the plant.</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">vi. </span>Costs of <span class="bold">incidental operations </span>not necessary to bring the asset to its required location and condition. The reason is that the asset is capable of operating in the manner intended by management even without such operations. The expenses and income related to such operations are recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Specialised machinery for a manufacturing company requires engineers to set it up properly to get it into working order. Then the company also calls in specialist painters to paint the machinery in the company colours. The expenses incurred for setting up the machine is capitalised. However, the painting expenses are not capitalised, but shown as an expense.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Finance lease</span></p>
<p>The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment held by an entity as lessee under a finance lease should be determined in accordance with IAS 17 Leases.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Subsequent costs &#x2013; capital and revenue expenditure</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Capital expenditure</span></p>
<p>Capital expenditure is the expenditure which <span class="bold">improves </span>the earning capacity of the asset so that it works more efficiently or lasts longer.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Revenue expenditure</span></p>
<p>Revenue expenditure is the expenditure which <span class="bold">maintains </span>the existing capacity of the asset i.e. so that it can do its daily work.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span></span>Costs of <span class="bold">day-to-day servicing </span>of an item are <span class="bold">revenue expenditure </span>and are not recognised in the carrying amount of the asset. <span class="bold">They are shown as expenses </span>in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Labour, consumables, small parts used for servicing. These are accounted by debiting &#x2018;repairs and maintenance&#x2019; in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Replacements </span>may be:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>At <span class="bold">regular intervals:</span> Parts of some items may need regular replacements</li>
<li>At <span class="bold">less frequent intervals</span></li>
<li><span class="bold">Non-recurring </span>replacements</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of these replacements is<span class="bold"> recognised in the carrying amount </span>of the property, plant and equipment if the recognition criteria are met (i.e. it is treated as <span class="bold">capital expenditure</span>).</p>
<p>It is logical that once the <span class="bold">new parts are recognised,</span> the <span class="bold">old parts </span>that are replaced should be <span class="bold">derecognised </span>(i.e. removed from the statement of financial position).</p>
<p>Subsequent to initial recognition, certain plant and equipment (e.g. aircraft, turbines etc) are required to carry out regular major inspections for faults regardless of whether parts of the item are replaced. The above principle of recognition is also applied to the cost of these inspections.</p>
<p>The new cost incurred is recognised and the earlier one is derecognised.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.5 Measurement after recognition</span></p>
<p>IAS 16 gives two options of accounting policy to choose from:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>either the <span class="bold">cost model;</span></li>
<li>or the<span class="bold"> revaluation model.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The entity should apply the policy that it selects to an <span class="bold">entire class </span>of property, plant and equipment.</p>
<p>The two models are explained as follows:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Cost model</span></p>
<p>According to Para 30 of IAS 16, after recognition as an asset, an item of property, plant and equipment should be carried at its cost less any accumulated depreciation<span class="bold"> </span>and any accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Revaluation model</span></p>
<p>According to Para 31 of IAS 16, after recognition as an asset, an item of property, plant and equipment whose fair value can be measured reliably shall be carried at a revalued amount, being its fair value at the date of the revaluation less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Inportant</p>
<p class="boxpara">Revaluation model can be adopted only when the fair value can be measured reliably.</p>
</div>
<p>Revaluations should be made with sufficient regularity to ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materially from that which would be determined using fair value at the end of the reporting period.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Zodiac enterprises purchased a building at the cost of $500,000 on 1Januray 2008. Professionally qualified and recognised experts value them at $700,000 as at 31 December 2009. Ignore depreciation.</p>

<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>We must increase the value of the building by $200,000 to make it equal to the fair value. Hence we debit the plant account.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Revaluation gain shall be recognised in other comprehensive income and will accumulate as revaluation surplus under equity. The accumulated revaluation surplus will be shown in the statement of financial position under other components of equity.</p>
<p>Gain on revaluation surplus is an unrealised gain and hence it is recognised in other comprehensive income.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Accounting for the revaluation adjustment</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">There are two possibilities:</span></p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>either an asset&#x2019;s carrying amount is increased<span class="bold">;</span></p>

If there was a <span class="bold">revaluation decrease </span>of the same asset <span class="bold">earlier </span>(which was recognised in statement of profit or loss, as required by IAS 16), then the increase should be recognised in statement of profit or loss to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease.</p>

<p><span class="bold">A class </span>is a grouping of assets of a <span class="bold">similar nature and use </span>in an entity&#x2019;s operations e.g. land, machinery, motor vehicles. An entity may, for the purpose of revaluation, adopt narrower classes. However, these classes should meet the requirements according to the definition in order to be classified as class.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Kevin Inc owns a number of buildings. Some of them are located in industrial areas and are used as factory buildings, while others, located in residential areas, are used to operate its retail business. These buildings can be easily segregated into two classes for revaluation, as both the classes form groups of assets of similar nature, used in an entity&#x2019;s operation.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The purpose of revaluing the entire class simultaneously is:</span></p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>to <span class="bold">avoid selective revaluation </span>of assets; and</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>Hence financial statements may then have <span class="bold">values that are a mixture </span>of costs and values as at different dates.</p>
<p>Both situations <span class="bold">may distort the financial statements </span>and therefore reduce their utility.</p>
<p>Items in a class <span class="bold">may be revalued on a rolling basis </span>provided that the revaluation is <span class="bold">completed within a short period </span>and the revaluations are <span class="bold">kept up-to-date </span>(e.g. all items in plant and machinery may be revalued over a period of 3 years).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Caro Co owns 3 buildings in 3 cities &#x2013; Pala, Ruritania and Zaroo. They were each bought for $100,000, and were all revalued in 2006.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Prices in Zaroo have increased dramatically as large multinationals have set up their establishments there, and similar buildings in Zaroo are now worth on average $175,000 on the open market. The prices in the other two cities remained more or less constant at $110,000 in Pala and $105,000 in Ruritania.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, all 3 buildings should be revalued in 2007 again, even though only prices in Zaroo have increased, since IAS 16 requires that the revaluations should not be done selectively. Once done, they shall be applied to the entire class of assets.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.7 Treatment of revaluation reserve and profit or loss on sale</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">When the asset is derecognised (sold),</span> the revaluation surplus included in equity should be transferred directly to retained earnings. Profit or loss on sale will be calculated in the usual manner i.e. sales proceeds less carrying value (in this case, revalued).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An asset had a carrying value of $50,000. It was revalued at $60,000 by crediting the increase of $10,000 to revaluation surplus. Later it was sold for $75,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The profit on sales is $15,000 (75,000 - 60,000) and it is presented in the statement of profit or loss. The revaluation surplus of $10,000 is transferred directly from the surplus account to the retained earnings.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">When the asset is used by an entity,</span> some of the revaluation surplus may be reallocated to retained earnings. In this case, the amount of the surplus transferred to retained earnings would be the <span class="bold">difference </span>between the <span class="bold">depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount </span>of the asset and the <span class="bold">depreciation based on the asset&#x2019;s original cost (refer to paragraph 41 of IAS 16). </span>The transfers mentioned are not<span class="bold"> made through the statement of profit or loss,</span> but directly from the revaluation surplus to retained earnings.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Blue Ltd has two buildings, P and Q, against which there were revaluation surplus of $535,000 and $265,000 respectively. P was disposed of; Q is still in use. Depreciation on the original cost of Q was $40,000 and on the revalued carrying amount, $66,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Following is the accounting treatment for the revaluation surplus for both building P and building Q.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Building P: the revaluation surplus of $535,000 is transferred directly to retained earnings:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/62-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Building Q: Blue Ltd may transfer $26,500 (i.e. 66,500 &#x2013; 40,000, the difference between the depreciation based on the revalued carrying amount of the asset and that based on its original cost) to retained earnings:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/62-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Significance of the transfer</span></p>
<p>Both the revaluation surplus and retained earnings appear under the heading &#x2018;equity&#x2019; in the statement of financial position. So why is this transfer needed? Normally the revaluation surplus is not a disposable profit, whereas retained earnings are. An entity can <span class="bold">distribute dividends </span>out of retained earnings but normally not from the revaluation surplus. Hence, by making this transfer, companies could distribute more dividends.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.8 Derecognition: Disposal gains and losses</span></p>
<p>&#x2018;Derecognition&#x2019; is the opposite of recognition. By &#x2018;recognition&#x2019; of an asset, we mean recognising the item as an asset in the accounting records and statement of financial position. Derecognition means <span class="bold">removing it from property, plant and equipment in the statement of financial position.</span> It may be converted into either other assets (e.g. from non-current asset to cash) or a loss / gain on derecognition or both.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">The carrying amount of an item of property, plant and equipment should be derecognised:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>on disposal; or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment should be included in profit or loss when the item is derecognised (unless IAS 17 requires otherwise on a sale and leaseback).</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Gains on the disposal </span>of property, plant and equipment should not be classified as revenue. In other words, they are shown under<span class="bold"> &#x2018;other income&#x2019;. </span>The disposal can happen in a <span class="bold">variety of ways </span>(e.g. by sale or by entering into a finance lease or by donation). In determining the <span class="bold">date of disposal </span>of an item, an entity applies the criteria in IFRS 15 Revenue from contract with customers for recognising revenue from the sale of goods (see Study Guide B1). Similarly, it applies the criteria in IAS 17 to a disposal by a sale and leaseback.</p>
<p>If an entity <span class="bold">recognises </span>the <span class="bold">cost of a replacement </span>for part of the item in the carrying value of an asset, (i.e. if it capitalises this cost), then it <span class="bold">derecognises </span>the carrying amount of the <span class="bold">replaced part </span>irrespective of whether the replaced part had been depreciated separately. The following examples ignore depreciation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The damaged control panel of a continuous process plant producing special film has been replaced at a cost of $100,000. The entity capitalises this cost. The carrying value of the damaged part which was replaced was $60,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The entity should derecognise the latter amount, by:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/63-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p>If it is <span class="bold">impractical to determine the carrying amount </span>of the replaced part, an entity may <span class="bold">use the cost of the replacement as an indication </span>of what the cost of the replaced part was at the time it was acquired or constructed.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing the special film example</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Suppose the carrying value of the replaced part is not known but it is known that the cost of the new part ($100,000) is 10% of the plant total&#x2019;s value today. The total cost of the plant when it was purchased earlier was $600,000. An indicative value of the cost of the replaced part (at the time it was acquired) can be taken at $600,000 x 1/10 = $60,000.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.9 Determination of the amount of gain or loss</span></p>
<p>The gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the <span class="bold">difference between the net disposal consideration, if any, and the carrying amount of the item.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">To continue further the previous example</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">If the control panel derecognised is sold at $25,000, then the loss on derecognition will be $35,000 (60,000 &#x2013; 25,000). If there was no sales values, then the loss on derecognition will be the entire carrying amount of $60,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/63-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p>The consideration receivable on disposal of an asset is <span class="bold">recognised initially at its fair value. </span>If payment is deferred, then it is taken at the <span class="bold">cash price equivalent.</span> The difference between the nominal amount of the consideration and the cash price equivalent is recognised as interest revenue in accordance with IFRS 15.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.10 Depreciation</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Meaning</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Depreciation </span>is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over its useful life.</p>
</div>
<p>According to Para 48 of IAS 16, the depreciation charge for each period should be recognised in the profit or loss unless it is included in the carrying amount of another asset.</p>
<p>Depreciation of an asset is a <span class="bold">necessary charge against profit.</span> Repairs and maintenance of an asset do not negate the need to depreciate it.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.11 Depreciable amount and depreciation period</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Depreciable amount </span>is the cost of an asset, or other amount substituted for cost, less its residual value.</p>
</div>
<p>According to Para 50 of IAS 16, the depreciable amount of an asset should be allocated on a systematic basis over its useful life.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Residual value </span>is the value which the entity expects to realise from the disposal of the asset at the end of its useful life.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Useful life </span>is the <span class="bold">period </span>over which the asset is likely to be in existence for an entity&#x2019;s use. It may also be denoted in terms of the <span class="bold">number of units </span>expected to be obtained from the asset.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Depreciable amount </span>is determined after <span class="bold">deducting residual value from cost.</span> In practice, the residual value may often be insignificant and therefore immaterial in the calculation of the depreciable amount.</p>
<p>So long as the asset&#x2019;s residual value does not exceed its carrying amount, depreciation is recognised even if the fair value of the asset exceeds its carrying amount.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A firm follows a cost model of depreciation.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The carrying value of machinery is $40,000 and its residual value, $20,000. Its fair value is $50,000. Depreciation should be charged on $40,000 &#x2013; $20,000 = $20,000 which is the depreciable amount. The fact that fair value exceeds carrying value is of no consequence for this purpose.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the residual value becomes equal to or greater than the asset&#x2019;s carrying amount, then the depreciation charge becomes zero. This continues until its residual value subsequently decreases to an amount below its carrying amount.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The carrying value of machinery is $20,000 and its residual value is $21,000. The depreciation charge should be zero, as the residual value is greater than the carrying value.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">When does depreciation begin and cease?</span></p>
<p>Depreciation <span class="bold">begins </span>when the asset is available for use at the location and in the condition intended by management.</p>
<p>Depreciation of an asset <span class="bold">ceases </span>at the <span class="bold">earlier </span>of the following:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The date on which the asset is classified as held for sale (or included in a disposal group that is classified as held for sale) in accordance with IFRS 5; and</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The date on which the asset is derecognised.</p>
<p>Depreciation <span class="bold">does not cease </span>when the asset becomes idle or is retired from active use, unless it is fully depreciated.</p>
<p>However, <span class="bold">under the usage method of depreciation,</span> if there is no production, the depreciation charge can be zero.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sunto Ltd has two factories. At factory 1, depreciation is charged on a time basis and at factory 2 it is charged on a usage basis. There is a machine costing $50,000 at each factory.</p>
<p class="boxpara">During 2005-2006, both machines remained idle.</p>
<p class="boxpara">For factory 1, depreciation will be charged as it is based on the time method; whereas for factory 2, it will not be charged, as it is based on the usage method.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Depreciation after revaluation</span></p>
<p>After a revaluation, depreciation will be based on the revalued amount. The full depreciation amount is charged as an expense to the statement of profit or loss.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Borrowing costs and qualifying assets</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Borrowing costs </span>are interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Qualifying asset: </span>A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale.</p>
</div>
<p>IAS 23 does not state what &#x2018;substantial period of time&#x2019; means. It&#x2019;s up to management to decide when an asset is a qualifying asset, taking into account, among other factors, the nature of the asset. An asset that normally takes more than a year to be ready for its intended use will usually be a qualifying asset.US GAAP does not include the term &#x201C;substantial&#x201D; while defining qualifying assets.</p>
<p>Thus, depending upon the circumstances, qualifying assets can be:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>inventories</li>
<li>manufacturing plants</li>
<li>power generation facilities</li>
<li>intangible assets e.g. internally developed software</li>
<li>investment properties</li>
</ul>
<p>From the definition of qualifying assets, it is clear that the necessity of a substantial period of time to get ready for intended use is the primary condition for being a qualifying asset. As a result, inventories that are manufactured over a short period of time are not qualifying assets. Similarly, assets that are ready for their intended use or sale when acquired are not qualifying assets.</p>
<p>Borrowing costs can only be capitalised on <span class="bold">qualifying assets.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Capitalisation of borrowing costs</span></p>
<p>According to <span class="bold">Para 8 of IAS 23,</span> an entity shall capitalise borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset as part of the cost of that asset. An entity shall recognise other borrowing costs as an expense in the period in which it incurs them.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>Note that borrowing costs not attributable to qualifying assets are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation</span></p>
<p>According to <span class="bold">Para 10 of IAS 23,</span> the borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset are those borrowing costs that would have been avoided if the expenditure on the qualifying assets had not been made.</p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) Specific borrowing costs, e.g., interest on the funds borrowed specifically</span></p>
<p>Interest on the funds borrowed <span class="bold">specifically </span>for the purpose of obtaining / constructing a particular qualifying asset, less any investment income on the temporary investment of these borrowings is eligible for capitalisation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An office building is constructed for $100,000, out of which $75,000 is borrowed and interest of $7,500 was paid. At some point when the loan was not needed, part of the $75,000 borrowed was put into a high interest deposit account and interest of $2,000 was received. The net interest paid ($7,500 - $2,000) can be capitalised subject to the rules of commencement and cessation of capitalisation discussed later in this section.</p>
</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Borrowing costs on funds borrowed generally and used for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.</span></p>
<p>Sometimes, a specific loan may not be taken out. Instead, the company may use part of general loans to finance the construction of an asset. The capitalisation rate shall be the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the entity that are outstanding during the period, <span class="bold">other than </span>borrowings made specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The weighted average borrowing cost of funds borrowed generally by a company is 9%, out of which $80,000 is used for a machine. The company also has a specific loan for the construction of the machine of $10,000, where the interest rate is 12%. $7,200 (80,000 x 9%) can be capitalised subject to the rules of commencement and cessation of capitalisation discussed later in this section.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Commencement of capitalisation</span></p>
<p>According to Para 17 of IAS 23, an entity shall begin capitalising borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset on the commencement date. The commencement date is the date when the entity first meets all the following conditions:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>it incurs expenditure for the asset;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>it incurs borrowing costs; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>it undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A term loan for construction of a building was obtained on 1.1.X6 and interest started accruing on the loan from that date. Construction materials were purchased on the same date. Actual construction also commenced on the same date. All the three conditions are satisfied and the company can commence to capitalise the interest.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Cessation of capitalisation</span></p>
<p>According to Para 22 of IAS 23, an entity shall cease capitalising borrowing costs when all the activities necessary to prepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are substantially complete.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Erection of machinery is fully completed on 30 September 2007. However, due to administrative reasons, it is not used till 31 December 2007. Interest capitalisation, i.e. adding the interest accrued to the cost of asset, will cease on 30 September 2007. Interest after 30 September 2007 will be shown as an expense in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">5. Suspension of capitalisation</span></p>
<p>The above are the rules of commencement and cessation of capitalisation of interest. In between, sometimes capitalisation may have to be temporarily stopped. According to Para 20 of IAS 23, an entity shall suspend capitalisation of borrowing costs during extended periods in which it suspends active development of a qualifying asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Construction work on a partially completed building is halted due to an order by the local authorities. Borrowing costs should not be capitalised during this period.</p>
</div>
<p>However, IAS 23 gives certain instances where capitalisation of borrowing costs need not be suspended.</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>When it carries out substantial technical and administrative work.</li>
<li>When a temporary delay is a necessary part of the process of getting an asset ready for its intended use or sale.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, capitalisation continues during the extended period that high water levels delay construction of a bridge, if such high water levels are common during the construction period in the geographical region involved.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Government grants</span></p>
<p>IAS 20 <span class="bold">Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance </span>is to be applied in the accounting for, and disclosure of, government grants.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Government </span>refers to government, government agencies and similar bodies whether local, national or international.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Government assistance </span>can be defined as an action by government designed to provide an economic benefit specific to an entity or range of entities qualifying under certain criteria.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Government grants </span>are assistance by government in the form of transfers of resources to an entity in return for past or future compliance with certain conditions relating to the operating activities of the entity.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Fair value </span>is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between a knowledgeable, willing buyer and a knowledgeable, willing seller in an arm&#x2019;s length transaction.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Conditions for recognition</span></p>
<p>Government grants, including non-monetary grants at fair value, should not be recognised until there is reasonable assurance that:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the entity will comply with the conditions attaching to them; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the grants will be received.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The local government requires that the grant for solar energy equipment should be subject to the condition that, after the payment of the entity&#x2019;s share of cost and after the installation of the equipment, it will be verified and certified by the prescribed authorities. Similarly, it also requires an undertaking from the entity that it will comply with the maintenance requirements and standards for 10 years.</p>
<p class="boxpara">After the equipment is certified and the undertaking is given, the government authorities issue a letter confirming compliance. Once the letter is received, the conditions given in IAS 20 are satisfied and the entity may recognise the grant irrespective of the date of receipt.</p>
</div>
<p>The <span class="bold">receipt </span>of a grant <span class="bold">may not necessarily mean </span>that the <span class="bold">conditions </span>attaching to the grant have been or will be <span class="bold">fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The manner of receiving the grant </span>(i.e. whether it is received in cash or as a reduction of a liability to the government) <span class="bold">does not affect the accounting method </span>to be adopted in regard to the grant.</p>
<p>A <span class="bold">forgivable loan </span>from the government is to be <span class="bold">recognised as a government grant </span>when there is <span class="bold">reasonable assurance that the entity will meet the terms </span>for forgiveness of the loan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">A contingent liability or contingent asset </span>related to a government grant is treated in accordance with <span class="bold">IAS 37 </span>Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Approaches</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Income versus capital</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Government grants </span>should be recognised as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs which they are intended to compensate, on a systematic basis. They should not be credited directly to shareholders&#x2019; interests.</p>
</div>
<p>Recognising the grants as income is known as the <span class="bold">income approach; </span>crediting them directly to shareholders&#x2019; interests without recognising the grant in profit or loss is <span class="bold">the capital approach. </span>It is evident that the <span class="bold">IAS requires the income approach </span>to be followed. IAS 20 gives arguments in favour of both approaches, but concludes in favour of the income approach. The income approach requires that government grants are recognised in profit or loss on a systematic basis so as to match them with the related costs. Grants related to <span class="bold">depreciable assets </span>are usually recognised as income over <span class="bold">the periods and in proportions in which depreciation is charged </span>on the assets.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A machine was purchased on 1 January 2006 for $90,000, depreciable on a straight-line basis over 3 years. A government grant of $27,000 was received.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Grants related to assets </span>are government grants whose primary condition is that an entity qualifying for them should purchase, construct or otherwise acquire long-term assets.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Subsidiary conditions may also be attached restricting the type or location of the assets or the periods during which they are to be acquired or held.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Two alternative methods are available for presentation of these grants:</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Deferred income; or</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Deduction from asset value.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Deferred income</span></p>
<p>This method treats government grants as deferred income, recognised as income over the useful life of the assets. The balance not yet recognised as income is presented in the statement of financial position as deferred income. Each year an appropriate part of that should be transferred to statement of profit or loss.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Deduction from asset value</span></p>
<p>This method deducts the government grant from the carrying amount of the asset. As the carrying value is reduced, the depreciation charge is reduced. By reducing the charge of depreciation, indirectly the grant is recognised as income.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Scorpio Co purchased a depreciating asset on 1 January 2001 for $100,000. It is expected to last for 5 years. Scorpio Co received a grant equal to 40% of this amount.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The residual value is expected to be negligible. The company uses the straight-line method of depreciation.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case the accounting for the grant and depreciation under the two alternatives is as follows:</p>

<p class="boxpara">Here, the asset is depreciated as normal</p>

<p class="boxpara">This means that while depreciation of $20,000 is deducted as an expense, $8,000 is credited as income each year, giving an annual net expense of $12,000 (i.e. $20,000 &#x2013; $8,000) in the statement of profit or loss.</p>

<p>The government may transfer a non-monetary asset such as land to an entity. It is <span class="bold">usual to record </span>the grant as well as the asset at <span class="bold">fair value. Alternatively,</span> it may be recognised at <span class="bold">a nominal amount.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Government allotted a plot of land free of charge to Cosmo Co, which was setting up a plant in an undeveloped area. The value of the plot in the market is $400,000. Cosmo Co may record this grant at $400,000 (fair value) or at a nominal value of, say $20,000.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Grants related to income </span>are government grants other than those related to assets.</p>
</div>
<p>These grants may be presented:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Either as income (a separate credit or under &#x2018;other income&#x2019; in the statement of profit or loss);</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Or as a deduction from the related expense.</p>
<p>One opinion is that the separation of the grant from expenses facilitates comparison between expenses in the sense that the expense figure is not distorted. However, some argue that an entity might not have incurred those expenses if they were not sure of receiving the grant. Therefore it is appropriate to deduct the grant from the related expense.</p>
<p>The IAS explains arguments in favour of both approaches and concludes that <span class="bold">either method is acceptable.</span></p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Definition of non-current assets held for sale</span></p>
<p>Before examining the case of non-current assets held for sale, let us first understand the types of tangible non-current assets:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span>Property, plant and equipment </span>e.g. building, machinery, computers used for the business. Traditionally these assets are called non-current assets. In some cases, these may also be called owner-occupied properties and used for the business of the owners.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2. </span>Investment properties </span>e.g. rented plot of land held for capital appreciation only.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">3. </span>Non-current assets held for sale:</span> These are dealt with by IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.</p>
<p>Property, plant and equipment and investment property have a value in use for the entity, whereas non-current assets held for sale are expected to bring value by way of sale.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity shall classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as <span class="bold">held for sale </span>if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.</p>
</div>
<p>A distant possibility of sale is not sufficient. The asset (or disposal group) must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets (or disposal groups) and its sale must be <span class="bold">highly probable.</span></p>
<p>For the sale to be treated as being <span class="bold">highly probable, the following conditions </span>are to be met:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An appropriate level of management must be committed to sell the asset or the disposal group.</li>
<li>An active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan must have been initiated.</li>
<li>The sale should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed <span class="bold">sale within 1 year.</span></li>
<li>It is unlikely that any significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Generic Neon Signs stopped using a plant during 2003. In the same year, it let the plant out on lease to Garry Electrical and now foresees that the plant will be of no further use to it. It is now negotiating the sale of the plant to Garry Electrical. Therefore, in its financial statements for 2003, Generic will present the plant as held for sale rather than on lease.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 A disposal group</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">A disposal group is a </span>group of assets to be disposed of, by sale or otherwise, <span class="bold">together as a group in a single transaction,</span> and liabilities directly associated with those assets that will be transferred in the transaction.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The group includes goodwill acquired in a business combination if the group is a <span class="bold">cash-generating unit </span>to which goodwill has been allocated in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs 80&#x2013;87 of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets (as revised in 2004) or if it is an operation within such a cash-generating unit.</p>
</div>
<p>If we analyse the above definition, we identify the following components of the definition:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>It is a group of <span class="bold">assets and the liabilities </span>directly associated with it.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An item of plant was acquired for $5m with the help of a bank loan for which the plant was offered as a security. The outstanding balance on the loan is $2m. The plant cannot be sold unless the loan is either repaid, or taken over by the purchaser of the plant. The liability is directly associated with the plant.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The group is to be <span class="bold">disposed </span>of in a <span class="bold">single transaction.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>If the group is the <span class="bold">cash-generating unit </span>to which goodwill has been allocated, or an operation in such a unit, it will <span class="bold">include the value of the goodwill.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement of a non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale</span></p>
<p>A non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale is <span class="bold">measured at the lower of its carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. </span>It can be seen that this method of valuation is similar to the valuation of inventory rather than property, plant and equipment. The reason is that the nature of these assets is similar to inventory which is a current asset expected to be sold soon.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>If an asset (or disposal group) is <span class="bold">newly acquired </span>as part of a business combination, it shall be measured at <span class="bold">fair value less costs to sell.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span><span class="bold">If the sale is expected to occur </span>after more than one year,<span class="bold"> the costs to sell would be incurred in the future and their </span>future value<span class="bold"> should be used only after </span>conversion into<span class="bold"> </span>present value,<span class="bold"> i.e. they should be discounted. Any increase in such costs which arises from the passage of time is recognised as a financing cost.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A plant&#x2019;s fair value is calculated to be $250,000 and the costs to sell the plant after two years will be $20,000. The present value of cost to sell is estimated to be $17,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore the costs to sell are taken to be $17,500, and the fair value less costs to sell will be $250,000 &#x2013; $17,500 = $232,500.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span><span class="bold">Just </span>before the initial classification<span class="bold"> of the asset as held for sale, the </span>asset shall be<span class="bold"> </span>remeasured <span class="bold"> in accordance with the applicable IFRS.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">d) </span><span class="bold">What happens if </span>certain assets are excluded from the scope of IFRS 5, but which form part of the disposal group?</p>
<p>Such assets are to be measured in accordance with the applicable IFRS, before the rule of measurement stated above is applied to the group. This is to be done both at the time of initial classification of the group as a disposal group and on subsequent measurement.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">IFRS 5 excludes deferred tax assets, which are governed by IAS 12 Income Taxes. If the disposal group includes a deferred tax asset, it is remeasured in accordance with IAS 12 immediately before initial classification of the group as held for sale or its subsequent remeasurement.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.3 Impairment loss</span></p>
<p>The above valuation method may lead to a situation where the carrying value of a non-current asset (or disposal group) classified as held for sale needs to be reduced to<span class="bold"> fair value less costs to sale (which is lower than the carrying value). The shortfall is recognised as an impairment loss.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Subsequent increase in value</span></p>
<p>When fair value less costs to sell increases subsequently, an entity recognises the gain only to the extent of any cumulative impairment loss previously recognised in accordance with IFRS 5 or IAS 36.</p>
<p>In the case of a disposal group, on subsequent remeasurement of the asset, if some gain has already been recognised, then that part is not again recognised as a gain.</p>
<p><span class="bold">When the asset (or disposal group) is sold.</span></p>
<p>A gain or loss not previously recognised by the date of the sale of a non-current asset (or disposal group) shall be recognised at the date of derecognition.</p>
<p><span class="bold">No depreciation or amortisation</span></p>
<p>While an asset is classified as held for sale or belongs to a group classified as such, it is not depreciated or amortised.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.4 Presentation of a non-current asset or disposal group classified as held for sale</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Non-current assets classified as held for sale or assets belonging to the disposal group are presented separately from the other assets in the statement of financial position.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity classifies a group of assets as a disposal group held for sale. It shall not present those assets under property, plant and equipment or current assets. It shall instead present the group separately in the statement of financial position.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.1 The peculiar nature of investment properties</span></p>
<p>The properties discussed in the earlier section are <span class="bold">owner-occupied properties,</span> used for the purpose of the business (e.g. factory or office building) and the land on which they are built.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">An investment property </span>is property (land or a building &#x2013; or part of a building or both) held (by the owner or by the lessee under a finance lease) <span class="bold">to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both,</span> rather than for:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>sale in the ordinary course of business.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">An investment property is:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">1. </span>Land held for long-term capital appreciation or for currently undetermined future use.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">2. </span>A building owned or held by the entity under a finance lease which is either leased out or is vacant, but held to be leased out.</p>
</div>
<p>As seen from the definition and subsequent discussions, <span class="bold">judgment is needed </span>to determine whether a property qualifies as investment property. In order to maintain consistency, an <span class="bold">entity develops criteria </span>which have to be followed for the classification of assets into investment property and non-investment property.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Recognition</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Investment property </span>should be recognised as an asset <span class="bold">when and only when:</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">a) </span>It is probable that the <span class="bold">future economic benefits </span>that are associated with the investment property <span class="bold">will flow </span>to the entity; <span class="bold">and</span></p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The <span class="bold">cost </span>of the investment property <span class="bold">can be measured reliably.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Modern Ventures Plc constructed a building at a cost of $2m with an intention to let it out. Municipal authorities contended that it has not followed the stipulated procedures or plans and ordered Modern Ventures to demolish a part of the building. Construction is complete: only an approval from the municipal authorities in the form of a &#x2018;completion certificate&#x2019; is to be received.</p>
<p class="boxpara">If we look at the conditions mentioned earlier, the second condition is satisfied i.e. the cost of the property can be measured reliably. However, it is not yet probable that the future economic benefits associated with the property in the form of rent income or capital appreciation will flow to Modern. The first condition is not satisfied.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore, Modern should not recognise the property as investment property. It may have to consider an impairment loss under IAS 16.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Measurement at recognition to be at cost</span></p>
<p>According to Para 20 of IAS 40, an investment property should be <span class="bold">measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs should be included </span>in the initial measurement.</p>
<p>The meaning of cost is the same as that under IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.2 Measurement after recognition</span></p>
<p>IAS 40 stipulates that an entity should choose as its accounting policy:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>either the <span class="bold">fair value model;</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span><span class="bold">or </span>the <span class="bold">cost model</span></p>
<p>The policy selected should be applied to all of its investment property.</p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Fair value </span>is the <span class="bold">price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability </span>in an orderly transactions <span class="bold">between market participants </span>at the measurement date.</p>
<p class="boxpara">After the issue of IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurements, most of the guidance provided under IAS 40 for determining the fair value of an investment property has been deleted. This area is now dealt by IFRS 13 which provides guidance on determination of fair value of non-financial asset based on highest and best use of an asset.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">After initial recognition, an entity selecting the fair value model </span>should measure <span class="bold">all of its investment property at fair value. </span>We have seen that initial recognition will be at cost for all the investment properties.</p>
<p>There is a rebuttable presumption that an entity can determine fair value on a continuing basis. Only in rare exceptions change from fair value model to cost model is permitted.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.3 Gain or loss on change in the fair value</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property should be <span class="bold">recognised in the profit or loss </span>for the period in which it arises.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Cost model</span></p>
<p>After initial recognition, an entity that chooses the cost model should measure all of its investment property in accordance with IAS 16&#x2019;s requirements for that model, other than those that meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.</p>
<p>After initial recognition, investment property is accounted for in accordance with the cost model as set out in IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, i.e. at cost less accumulated depreciation less accumulated impairment losses.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Transfers</span></p>
<p>We have seen that a property satisfying certain conditions is classified as an investment property. If the conditions change, a necessity may arise to <span class="bold">transfer a property from investment to another category and vice-versa.</span></p>
<p>The IAS states that such transfers should be made when and only when there is a <span class="bold">change in use.</span></p>

<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>The amount to be capitalised is $46,000 because cost of a non-current asset includes transportation charges and import duty but it excludes trade discount, refundable taxes i.e. tax on which set off is available, service charges for maintenance and cash discount. Therefore, the amount to be capitalised is calculated as follows:</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 6</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>A non-current asset is initially recorded at cost. However, an entity can revalue it at a later date, as revaluation is not compulsory.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 7</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>When an asset is upwardly revalued, the surplus is disclosed in reserves, is added to the value of the asset.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 8</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>The carrying value on 1 January 2008 = $10,000,000 &#x2013; ($10,000,000 x 4% x 4) = $8,400,000. Revalued amount amount = $11,550,000.</p>
<p>Upward revaluation surplus $<span class="bold">3,150,000.</span> Remaining useful life = 25 years &#x2013; 4 years = 21 years.</p>
<p>The new depreciation charge for 2008 = $11,550,000/21 years = <span class="bold">$550,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 9</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>The effect of revaluation is given prospectively (i.e. looking forward). Hence, the depreciation charge for the year ended 31 December 2013 is: $1,000,000 / 40 years = $25,000</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 11</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>Non-current assets can be tangible or non-tangible. Their value never remains constant as depreciation is charged at the end of each accounting period. The expected life of a tangible non-current asset exceeds one accounting period.</p>
