<p>Employee benefits form a very important constituent of an entity&#x2019;s expenses. Employers offer benefits that can be enjoyed by employees during the period commencing from the completion of the employee&#x2019;s service. These benefits are offered as a part of the remuneration package.</p>
<p>In this Study Guide we deal with post-employment benefits. These are retirement benefits, normally in the form of a pension. Under the schemes formulated in earlier years, payments were made on a &#x201C;pay as you go&#x201D; basis -where costs were charged to the statement of profit or loss as and when payments were made. However, there have been plenty of changes in the benefit schemes for post-employment.</p>
<p>As professionals you will be required to handle employment benefit schemes for your clients. This Study Guide will help you to understand the post-employment schemes, the method of measuring and recognising these schemes and how to account for them in the financial statements.</p>
