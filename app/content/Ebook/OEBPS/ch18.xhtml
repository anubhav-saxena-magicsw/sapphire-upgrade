<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Meaning of earnings per share (EPS)</span></p>
<p>EPS is the amount which an entity has earned per share for the given period.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Calculation of EPS in its simplest form</span></p>
<p>EPS is calculated as the ratio of earnings to the number of shares in issue. The numerator is the amount of earnings and the denominator is the number of shares.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Total earnings are $200,000 and total number of shares is 100,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">EPS is $2 (i.e. 200, 000/100,000).</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Why the trend of EPS may be a more accurate indicator of performance than a company&#x2019;s profit trend</span></p>
<p>The performance of a company can be judged from its profitability. Its investors expect it to be able to maintain or increase its profitability. The question that arises is: how do we measure this?</p>
<p>One possible measure is absolute profit. If profit increases, it may appear that the company has performed well. Consider the following example.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Brick Co earned a net profit of $8m in the year 20X5 and $10m in 20X6. The weighted average number of ordinary shares during 20X5 was 800,000 and during 20X6, 1,200,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The company appeared to perform better in 20X6 than 20X5 because its total profit increased.</p>
<p class="boxpara">There has been an increase of $2m in the profits (10 - 8), on the base profit of $8m. In percentage terms, this works out to: 2/8 x 100 = 25% (increase).</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, let us check this using EPS:</p>
<p class="boxpara">Basic EPS for 20X5 is 8,000,000/800,000 = $10</p>
<p class="boxpara">Basic EPS for 20X6 is 10,000,000/1,200,000 = $8.33</p>
</div>
<p>There has been a decrease of $1.67 ($10.00 - $8.33) in the earnings per share, in the base figure of $10. The percentage is: 1.67/10 x 100</p>
<p class="margin"> &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; &#x00A0; =16.7% (decrease)</p>
<p>If we take EPS as the basis, we find that the company has not performed well in 20X6. Which is the better basis?</p>
<p>There is no doubt that the company increased its total profits. However, the increase in profits was lower than the increase in resources available. Therefore the <span class="bold">additional resources were not utilised efficiently,</span> at least in the short run.</p>
<p>Therefore, the EPS is a better indicator of performance than a company&#x2019;s profit trend.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Define earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Calculate the EPS in the following circumstances:</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">i. </span>basic EPS</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">ii. </span>where there has been a bonus issue of shares/stock split during the year, and</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">iii. </span>where there has been a rights issues of shares during the year</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Definition of earnings (the numerator)</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>&#x2018;Earnings&#x2019; means profit or loss (or profit and loss from continuing operations, if presented) <span class="bold">attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity.</span></p>
<p>All items of income and expense for ordinary shareholders of the parent entity that are recognised in a period, including tax expenses and dividends on preference shares are considered when calculating the profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity shareholders. This means that the figure used as earnings is profit after income taxes and after preference dividends.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The earnings are calculated <span class="bold">after deducting the following:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">After-tax amounts of preference dividends</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Preference dividends are deducted from profits for the EPS calculation, as we need to use the earnings that could be paid out to equity shareholders. Preference dividends by their very nature are paid at a preference to ordinary shareholders.</p>
<p>The amount of preference dividend for the period does not include the amount of any preference dividends for cumulative preference shares paid or declared during the current period in respect of previous periods.</p>
<p>The basic calculation is very straightforward, as explained in the earlier section, but in practice there are a number of matters to deal with, and these will be discussed in turn below.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Calculations of Basic Earnings per Share</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Basic earnings per share shall be calculated by dividing <span class="bold">profit or loss attributable to ordinary equity holders of the parent entity </span>(the numerator) by <span class="bold">the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding </span>(the denominator) during the period.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">If we put this into equation form, we get</span></p>
<p><img src="images/279-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">We have just seen the meaning of earnings. The figure of earnings forms the numerator of the EPS calculations. Now let us understand how the number of shares is calculated.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Number of shares (the denominator)</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">For the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share, the number of ordinary shares shall be the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Why is a weighted average required?</span></p>
<p>This is because the numerator (earnings) and the denominator (number of shares) may not necessarily be comparable. Earnings relate to a<span class="bold"> PERIOD </span>(the period covered by the statement of profit or loss). However, the number of shares relate to a particular<span class="bold"> DATE </span>(reporting date).</p>
<p><span class="bold">How is weighted average calculated?</span></p>
<p>Calculation of weighted average involves two factors: the <span class="bold">number </span>of shares and the <span class="bold">period </span>for which they were outstanding. A <span class="bold">time weighting factor </span>is used, being the number of days for which the shares are outstanding as a proportion of the total days in the period. It can be calculated based on the balance of shares or the number of shares in each transaction.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">From the following information, calculate the weighted average first, then EPS.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/280-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Weighted average based on the balance:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, <span class="bold">the period for which the balance remained unchanged is used in the calculation of weighted average.</span> For example, the balance of 50,000 shares was constant from 1 January to 31 May 20X6, i.e. 5 months. Therefore, a weight of 5 will be attached to the balance of 50,000:</p>
<table class="table" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="p3">50,000 x 5/12 =<br/>
110,000 x 4/12 =<br/>

25,000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="none1"><span class="bold">Weighted average =</span></td>
<td><span class="bold">82,500</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="boxpara">Now, it is easier to calculate the EPS:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/280-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Bonus shares</span></p>
<p>When bonus shares are issued, the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the event (e.g. a bonus issue) is <span class="bold">adjusted as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period reported. </span>This change in the number of shares does not need a weighted average calculation.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Panama Tiles had an issued capital of 2m shares of $1 each on 31December 20X6. It issues, on 1April 20X7, bonus shares in the ratio of 1:2 (1 share for every 2 existing). 1m shares (1/2 x 2m) are issued, increasing the number of shares issued to 3m.</p>
<p class="boxpara">For both the years, 20X6 and 20X7, the number of shares will be treated as 3m. There is no need to calculate any weighted average.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.5 Rights issue</span><a href="videos/Earnings per Share Part 2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p><span class="bold">What is a rights issue?</span></p>
<p>A rights issue is an <span class="bold">issue of new shares for cash </span>offered to the existing shareholders as a right. Usually, company law stipulates that the new shares issued should first be offered to existing shareholders as a right. This ensures that the shareholding pattern and the control over a company are preserved. However, if the shareholder does not want the shares, he can transfer the rights to others.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Paul is a 20% shareholder of Paulson Ltd. The company issues 100,000 new shares. It must offer 20,000 shares to Paul as a right. It is then up to Paul to decide whether he wants to buy them.</p>
</div>
<p>If a rights issue is for full value (i. e. for the fair value of the shares), there will be a proportionate change in the resources available to the entity. The rules for the calculation of weighted average stated in paragraph 2.2 are applicable.</p>
<p>However, if the exercise price is lower than the fair value of the shares, there is an element of bonus in the rights issue. The number of shares is <span class="bold">adjusted as if the event had occurred at the beginning of the earliest period reported.</span></p>
<p>The number of ordinary shares to be used in calculating the <span class="bold">earnings per share for all periods before the rights issue </span>is the number of ordinary shares outstanding before the issue, <span class="bold">multiplied by the following factor:</span></p>
<p><img src="images/281-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Theoretical ex-rights price (TERP)</span></p>
<p>Usually, certain period is stipulated for the rights issue. The shareholders are required to apply for rights shares within that period. During this period, the price of shares is affected by the rights attached to them. Such a price is known as a &#x2018;cum-rights&#x2019; price (&#x2018;including rights&#x2019; price). The purchaser who purchases the shares during this period also receives the rights.</p>
<p>Once the right issue expires, the purchaser of shares no longer has a right to apply for rights shares. Then the shares and their price become&#x2019; ex-rights&#x2019; i.e. without the rights. Theoretical ex-rights price is the price that a share will theoretically have after the rights period expires. TERP is based on the company&#x2019;s market capitalisation and the number of shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The theoretical ex-rights fair value per share is calculated in turn as follows:</p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/281-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>This presents a very interesting situation! The principles discussed in paragraphs 2.2 and 2.3 are to be applied simultaneously. This is how it is done.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company has an issued capital of 200,000 shares of $1 each. It makes a rights issue of 1share for every 2 shares held on 1/10/20X7at $1.50 per share. The accounting period is a calendar year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The fair value of shares the day before the rights issue was $2.5 each. The theoretical ex-rights price is calculated as:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/281-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara">Therefore theoretical ex-rights price is $2.17.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Diluted EPS.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Meaning of dilution</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Dilution is a reduction in earnings per share or an increase in loss per share resulting from the assumption that convertible instruments are converted, that options or warrants are exercised, or that ordinary shares are issued upon the satisfaction of specified conditions.</p>
</div>
<p>Diluted EPS means an EPS that is reduced or diluted due to increase in the number of shares (the denominator) without a proportionate increase in the earnings (the numerator).</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Potential ordinary shares</span></p>
<p>In the discussions on basic EPS so far, we divided earnings by the number of shares. While determining the number of shares, we considered only the shares which entitle the holders to a share in the earnings <span class="bold">at present.</span></p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. Calculating the diluted EPS.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Adjustments required to the numerator and denominator</span></p>
<p>Both the numerator (earnings) and denominator (number of shares) that are used to calculate the basic EPS <span class="bold">need to be adjusted when calculating the diluted EPS.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Adjustments to the denominator (number of shares)</span></p>
<p>The number of ordinary shares will be the weighted average number of <span class="bold">ordinary shares </span>calculated for the basic EPS, <span class="bold">plus </span>the weighted average number of ordinary shares that <span class="bold">would be issued </span>on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.</p>
<p>Dilutive potential ordinary shares shall be deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares at the beginning of the period or, if later, the date of issue of the potential ordinary shares.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The existing number of ordinary shares of Zanco Ltd is 80,000. Bonds worth $100,000 are to be converted in future into 20,000 ordinary shares. For the purpose of calculation of the number of shares, these potential shares are added and the total number is 80,000 + 20,000 = 100,000.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Adjustments to the numerator (earnings)</span></p>
<p>As you can see above, in order to calculate diluted EPS, we basically &#x2018;fast-forward&#x2019; in time and assume that the items e.g. bonds or preference shares are converted into shares. However, if we convert the items into shares, we also have to then remove any interest or dividends which would be payable on these. IAS 33 therefore specifically states that:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">i. </span>Any dividends, related to dilutive potential ordinary shares. Until the conversion, such items are deducted from net profits to calculate the profits available to the ordinary shareholders. After the conversion into ordinary shares, this dividend is not deductible.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">100,000 9% preference shares are converted into 200,000 ordinary shares. Upon conversion, since the preference shares will no longer exist, the dividend of $9,000 is not payable on preference shares. This amount is added to the profits available for ordinary shareholders.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>Any interest on the bonds, debentures or loan that is to be converted into ordinary shares; after they are converted into shares, the interest is no longer payable.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing the above example of Zanco</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Bonds worth $100,000 bearing 8% interest are to be converted into 20,000 ordinary shares. The tax rate is 30%. Earnings available to ordinary shareholders are $75,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">After the conversion, there will be no interest charge payable on the bonds. Therefore the savings net of tax are 8,000 &#x2013; (30% x 8,000) = 8,000 &#x2013; 2,400 = $5,600.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The revised earnings available for ordinary shareholders are 75,000 + 5,600 = $80,600.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The diluted EPS in this situation is 80,600/100,000 = $0.81.</p>
</div>

</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">5.2 Anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares</span></p>
<p>If EPS is going to be increased (loss per share decreased) as a result of potential shares being converted into ordinary shares, the potential shares are said to be anti-dilutive.</p>
<p>When deciding whether the potential ordinary shares are dilutive or anti-dilutive, the profit or loss from <span class="bold">continuing operations only </span>is considered. Items relating to <span class="bold">discontinued operations are excluded.</span></p>
<p>For the purpose of calculating diluted EPS per share, the entity <span class="bold">assumes conversion, exercise, or other issue of potential ordinary shares that would have a dilutive effect,</span> while those having the opposite effect, i.e.<span class="bold"> anti-dilutive, are ignored.</span></p>

<p>On 1 August 2011, Square issued another 30,000 ordinary shares and on 1 October 2011 the company issued a further 50,000 shares.</p>
<p>Both issues were made at par.</p>
<p><span class="bold">The weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year to 31 March 2012 was:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1"><span class="bold">A </span></span>165,000</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1"><span class="bold">B </span></span>160,000</p>

<p><span class="bold">Weighted average based on the balance:</span></p>
<p>In this case, the period for which the balance remained unchanged is used in the calculation of weighted average. For example, the balance of 50,000 shares was constant from 1 January to 31 May 2008, i.e. 5 months. Therefore, a weight of 5 will be attached to the balance of 50,000:</p>
