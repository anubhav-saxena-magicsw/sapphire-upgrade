<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">lease </span>is an agreement whereby the lessor conveys to the lessee, in return for a payment or series of payments, the right to use an asset for an agreed period of time.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">In simple terms, a lease is an arrangement by which a person / entity </span>(the lessee) can acquire the right to use an asset from <span class="bold">another person / entity </span>(the lessor), without making a full payment for the asset when <span class="bold">the arrangement </span>(the lease) commences. The lessee pays for the asset in instalments, over the period of the lease. As full payment<span class="bold"> for the use of the assets is </span>not made<span class="bold"> by the lessee,</span> the title of ownership of the asset remains with the lessor.</p>
<p>The essential characteristics of a lease are</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The existence of a<span class="bold"> lessor: </span>the lessor is the<span class="bold"> person who transfers the right </span>to use the asset for an agreed period of time to another person.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The existence of a<span class="bold"> lessee: </span>the lessee is the<span class="bold"> person who acquires the right </span>to use the asset for an agreed period of time from another person.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span><span class="bold">Transfer of the right to use an asset: </span>the lessor transfers the right to use an asset to the lessee. Normally the possession of the leased asset is handed over to the lessee. However, handing over the asset<span class="bold"> physically is not compulsory,</span> what is handed over<span class="bold"> is the right to use an asset.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Plain Co enters into an agreement with Jane Co to use a machine which remains within the factory premises of Jane Co as the cost of dismantling and reinstalling the machine is high.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The cost of the machine is $25,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Plain Co agrees to pay the full amount to Jane Co over 10 years, by paying $3,000 each year. The ownership or title of the machine remains with Jane Co.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The agreement mentioned above is a lease agreement where:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Plain Co </span>has the right to use the asset <span class="bold">the lessee.<br/>Jane Co is </span>the lender of the asset <span class="bold">the lessor.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">right to use the asset </span>is with <span class="bold">the lessee (Plain Co).</span><br/>
The <span class="bold">physical possession </span>of the machine is with <span class="bold">the lessor (Jane Co).</span><br/>
The <span class="bold">ownership </span>of the machine is with <span class="bold">the lessor (Jane Co).</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span><span class="bold">Lease payments </span>are the <span class="bold">instalments </span>which the lessee pays to the lessor in return for the right to use an asset.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span><span class="bold">Minimum lease payments</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Minimum lease payments </span>are <span class="bold">the payments over the lease term that the lessee is or can be required to make,</span> excluding contingent rent, costs for services and taxes to be paid by and reimbursed to the lessor, together with:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>for a lessee, any amounts guaranteed by the lessee or by a party related to the lessee; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>for a lessor, any residual value guaranteed to the lessor by:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the lessee;</li>
<li>a party related to the lessee; or</li>
<li>a third party unrelated to the lessor that is financially capable of discharging the obligations under the guarantee.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">6. </span><span class="bold">The lease term</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">lease term </span>is the <span class="bold">non-cancellable period for which the lessee has contracted to lease the asset,</span> together with any further terms for which the lessee has the option to continue to lease the asset, with or without further payment, when at the inception of the lease it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise the option.</p>
</div>
<p>This basically means that when the lease term is calculated, if the lessee has the option to use the asset for a further period for a very low payment, this extra term should be included in the lease term.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Finance lease</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">finance lease </span>is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of an asset. Title may or may not eventually be transferred.</p>
</div>
<p>If the risks and rewards incidental to ownership are transferred to the lessee, then the lease is a finance lease regardless of whether the ownership is transferred to the lessee or not.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Operating lease</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">operating lease </span>is a lease other than a finance lease.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Determining a lease type</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">The lease type </span>has to be determined on <span class="bold">inception of the lease </span>because the <span class="bold">accounting treatment </span>for assets acquired under the two lease types <span class="bold">is different.</span></p>
<p>The <span class="bold">inception of the lease </span>is the earlier of the date of the lease agreement and the date of commitment by the parties to the principal provisions of the lease.</p>
<p>It is this date on which a lease is classified as either an operating or a finance lease; and in the case of a finance lease, the amounts to be recognised at the commencement of the lease term are determined.</p>
<p>Determining a lease type requires determining whether the <span class="bold">risks and rewards incidental to ownership </span>of the leased asset <span class="bold">remain with the lessor </span>or are<span class="bold"> transferred to </span>the<span class="bold"> lessee.</span></p>
<p>While determining a lease type, it becomes essential to consider the <span class="bold">substance of the transaction rather than the form of the contract.</span> A similar-sounding <span class="bold">lease </span>gets <span class="bold"> classified differently </span>when we<span class="bold"> consider the substance of the transaction rather than the strict legal form of the contract.</span></p>
<p>A lease is normally <span class="bold">classified as a finance lease when any one or all of the following situations </span>arise:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">1. </span></span>The lease <span class="bold">transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee </span>by the end of the <span class="bold">lease term.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Earth Movers Ltd takes a bulldozer on lease from Earth Shakers Ltd. The terms of the lease state that the Earth Movers Ltd will pay an annual lease rent of $25,000 for the next 7 years.</p>
<p class="boxpara">At the end of the 7<sup>th</sup> year, the title of ownership of the bulldozer will be transferred to Earth Movers Ltd.</p>
<p class="boxpara">As the lease <span class="bold">transfers ownership of the asset to the lessee </span>by the end of the lease term, this lease is a <span class="bold">finance lease.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">2. </span></span>The <span class="bold">lessee has the option </span>to <span class="bold">purchase the asset at a price </span>that is expected to be sufficiently <span class="bold">lower than the fair value of the asset,</span> at <span class="bold">the date the option becomes exercisable.</span></p>
<p>It has to be<span class="bold"> reasonably certain </span>at the inception of the lease that the option will be exercised.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Software Inc has taken on lease a fleet of 20 cars from Transport Inc at a monthly lease of $1,000 per car for 60 months. At the end of 60 months, Software Inc has the option of purchasing the cars, by paying a nominal amount of $100 per car. The fair value of each car is expected to be $5,000 at that time. At the inception of the lease itself, Software Inc has indicated that it would exercise the option of purchasing the cars.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Required:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Determine the type of lease in this transaction.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<table style="margin-left: 0.5em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><p>The purchase cost for Software Inc for each car</p></td>
<td><p>$100</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>The expected fair value of each car at the end of 60 months</p></td>
<td><p>$ 5,000</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="boxpara">As, at the inception of the lease itself, it is certain that <span class="bold">the lessee </span>will purchase the fleet of cars at a price that is sufficiently <span class="bold">lower than the fair value of the fleet of cars,</span> this lease is a <span class="bold">finance lease.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">3. </span></span>The lease term is for the major part of <span class="bold">the economic life of the asset,</span> even if the title is not transferred.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Fine Co has leased a machine to Shine Co. Shine Co has to pay an annual lease of $4,500 to Fine Co for a period of 5 years. The estimated economic life of the machine is 10 years.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Required:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Determine whether this lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">A lease is classified as a finance lease if the lease term is for the major part of <span class="bold">the economic life of the asset </span>even if the title is not transferred.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, this lease term is for only half of the estimated <span class="bold">economic life of the asset. </span>Hence, if this lease does not satisfy any other condition which will classify it as finance lease, it will be classified as an <span class="bold">operating lease.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">4. </span></span>At the inception of the lease the present value of the <span class="bold">minimum lease payments </span>amounts to at least <span class="bold">substantially all of the fair value of the leased asset. </span>The standard does not define the term &#x2018;substantial&#x2019;. However, if the minimum lease payment is more than 90% of the fair value of the leased asset, it can be said to be substantial.</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">5. </span></span>The leased assets are of such a <span class="bold">specialised nature </span>that only <span class="bold">the lessee can use them without major modifications.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Persistent Inc takes on lease a telescope especially developed for it by Research Inc. This leased telescope cannot be leased out or sold to any other person by Research Inc unless it makes <span class="bold">major modifications </span>to the telescope.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Required:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Determine the type of lease in this transaction.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">As the telescope is of such a specialised nature that only the lessee can use it without major modifications, this lease is a <span class="bold">finance lease.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">6. </span></span>If the lessee can cancel the lease, then the <span class="bold">lessor&#x2019;s losses associated with the cancellation are borne by the lessee.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hook Co has leased out furniture to Crook Co at an annual lease rent of $2,500. The lease agreement stated that this lease is for a minimum period of 5 years. However, if Crook Co wishes to cancel the lease at an earlier date, then Crook Co has to compensate Hook Co for the losses that it will incur because of cancellation of the lease.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Required:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Determine whether this lease is a finance lease or an operating lease.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Answer</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">As Crook Co can cancel the lease, but has to bear Hook Co&#x2019;s losses associated with the cancellation, this is a finance lease.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">7. </span>Gains or losses </span>from the fluctuation in the fair value of the <span class="bold">residual accrue to the lessee.</span></p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">8. </span>The lessee </span>has the ability to <span class="bold">continue the lease for a secondary period </span>at a <span class="bold">rent that is substantially lower than market rent.</span></p>
<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>If<span class="bold"> none </span>of the above<span class="bold"> conditions </span>are<span class="bold"> fulfilled </span>then it is an<span class="bold"> operating lease.</span></p>
</div>
<p>It is important to remember that <span class="bold">all the situations mentioned above are not conclusive </span>in the classification of the lease type. Each lease agreement has to be considered individually, keeping in mind that the most important feature for classification is <span class="bold">whether the risks and rewards incidental to ownership </span>of the <span class="bold">leased asset lie with the lessor or the lessee.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Method of classifying leases of land and buildings</span><a href="videos/Lease Part 2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>For classifying a lease involving land and buildings, land and buildings elements are required to be separated. The minimum lease payments are allocated between the land and buildings elements in proportion to their relative fair values. The land element of lease is normally classified as an operating lease however, when the title of land passes to the lessee at the end of the lease term it is classified as finance lease. However, according to the amendment made to IAS 17 in April 2009, a long term lease of land should be classified on the basis of its substance and not only based on its legal form. In the case of long term land agreements, the risks and rewards would be automatically transferred to the lessee, even though the title is not transferred. In such a case, the lease for the land should be treated as a finance lease.The buildings element is classified as an operating or finance lease by applying the classification criteria in IAS 17.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Juke Co acquired land on lease from Buke Co. for the period of 999 years. The title is not expected to pass to Juke Co.</p>
<p class="boxpara">However, due to the long duration of the lease, significant risks and rewards associated with the land during the lease term are to be transferred to the lessee despite there being no transfer of title.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this situation, the lease should be treated as a finance lease and not as an operating lease.</p>
</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Account for operating leases in the financial statements of the lessor and the lessee. [Learning Outcome c]</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 In the books of the lessee</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">IAS 17 </span>states that <span class="bold">lease rental payments </span>under an<span class="bold"> operating lease </span>shall be<span class="bold"> recognised as an expense on a straight line basis over the lease term </span>unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the user&#x2019;s benefit.</p>
<p><span class="bold">An asset acquired under a lease agreement is not recognised as an asset in the books of the lessee.</span></p>
<p>This means that the <span class="bold">lease rentals </span>which the <span class="bold">lessee pays </span>periodically, when he acquires an asset under <span class="bold">an operating lease,</span> are <span class="bold">debited to the statement of profit or loss as an expense.</span></p>

<p><img src="images/102-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 In the books of the lessor</span></p>
<p>The leased asset continues to be reflected as a non-current asset in the financial statements of the lessor and is depreciated in the normal manner.</p>
<p>The lease rentals received are credited in the statement of profit or loss of the lessor.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. Account for finance leases in the financial statements of the lessor and the lessee.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Accounting treatment for finance lease in the books of the lessee</span></p>
<p>IAS 17 states that assets acquired by way of finance leases are to be accounted for in<span class="bold"> the books of the lessee </span>in the <span class="bold">same manner as credit purchases are recorded.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Recognition of an asset and a liability</span></p>
<p>The journal entry to capitalise the asset is:</p>
<p><img src="images/102-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Being asset acquired by a finance lease</p>
<p>The amount to be recorded is the <span class="bold">lower </span>of the <span class="bold">fair value of the asset </span>and the <span class="bold">present value </span>of the <span class="bold">minimum lease payments.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Alpha Ltd acquired a machine on lease from Beta Ltd. Alpha Ltd has to bear the repairs and maintenance charges of the machine and can also realise the residual value at the end of its economic life.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The fair value of the machine is $50,000 and the present value of the minimum lease payments is $48,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this example:</p>
<p class="boxpara">The lease is a finance lease as both the risks (repairs and maintenance charges of the machine) and the rewards (realisation of the residual value at the end of the economic life) of ownership of the machine lie with Alpha Ltd (the lessee).</p>

<p>The <span class="bold">depreciation policy </span>for depreciable leased assets should be <span class="bold">consistent with the normal depreciation policy of the lessee for similar assets </span>(according to the requirements of IAS 16 and IAS 38).</p>
<p>If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset shall be fully depreciated over the shorter of:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the <span class="bold">life of the lease;</span> and</li>
<li>the <span class="bold">useful life of the asset.</span></li>

<p class="image"><img src="images/104-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 Accounting treatment in the books of the lessor</span></p>
<p>IAS 17 requires the leased asset to be recognised in the lessor&#x2019;s statement of financial position as a receivable and not as a non-current asset. The receivables should be measured at the net investment in the lease. The lessor will recognise receivables and derecognise the leased asset.</p>
<p>The net investment in the lease is defined as being the &#x201C;gross investment in the lease discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease&#x201D;. This gross investment is calculated as the lessee&#x2019;s minimum lease payments (which includes any residual value guaranteed by the lessee plus any unguaranteed amount accruing to the lessor).</p>
<p>The journal entry for recording this transaction is:</p>
<p><img src="images/104-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>The amount to be recognised is the <span class="bold">present value </span>of <span class="bold">minimum lease payments.</span></p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.3 Determination of the interest portion and the capital portion of the lease instalment</span></p>
<p>In order to account for the finance lease the lease rental has to be split into</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">interest </span>portion; and</li>
<li>The <span class="bold">capital </span>portion</li>
</ul>
<p>The<span class="bold"> actuarial </span>method can be used for apportioning <span class="bold">the lease rental payments:</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.4 The actuarial method</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>At the inception of the lease (when the lease starts), the lessor is credited with an amount equal to the fair value of the asset.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Any deposit paid to the lessor is then deducted from this amount.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The amount of capital repaid is deducted from the credit balance of the lessor&#x2019;s account every time a lease rental is paid.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>The interest portion is calculated by applying the rate of interest to the balance in lessor&#x2019;s account each year (reducing balance method).</p>
<p>The interest rate used is called the <span class="bold">interest rate implicit in the lease. </span>This rate spreads income derived from the lease over the period of the lease. This interest rate will be mentioned in the question.</p>
<p>As the reducing balance method is followed to calculate the amount of interest, the interest is highest in the early part of the lease term, and gradually reduces as capital is repaid.</p>

<p class="boxpara">Right Ltd has the right to continue to use the plant after the end of the five-year period for as long as it wishes to without further payment. The expected useful life of the plant is ten years, at the end of which the residual value is estimated to be nil.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Question 5</span></p>
<p>Heritage Ltd leased a delivery van, on 1 January 2013, with a fair value of $50,000 under a finance lease for 7 years.</p>
<p>The present value of the minimum lease payments is $47,500. The useful life of the vehicle to the business was estimated at 8 years with no final residual value. The company operates a policy of straight line depreciation.</p>
<p><span class="bold">In accordance with IAS 17 Leases, determine the depreciation charge on the vehicle in 2013.</span></p>

<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Self Examination Questions</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 17, the minimum lease payment for a lessee does not include contingent rent, costs for services and taxes to be paid by and reimbursed to the lessor.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 17 Leases, lease expense from operating leases shall be recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term, unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern.</p>
<p>Therefore charge to SOPL = [($40,000 + ($20,000 x 4 installments)] / 4 years= $30,000</p>
<p>Prepayment in SOFP = $40,000 + $20,000 - $30,000 = $30,000</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Since the instalments are paid at the end of the year, finance cost will be calculated on $50,000 for the entire year. Therefore the finance cost = $50,000 x 9% - $4,500.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">B.</span></p>
<p>If the risk and rewards of ownership in a lease are transferred to the lessee then it is a finance lease and not an operating lease.</p>
<p>According to IAS 17, lease of land and building should be split and classified according to the nature of lease.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p><img src="images/108-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>IAS17 Para 20 requires the asset to be stated initially at the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments.</p>
<p>Para 28 states that if it is reasonably certain that ownership will be obtained, then depreciation is charged over the useful life if that is longer than the lease term.</p>
