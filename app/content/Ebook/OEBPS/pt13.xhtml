<p>Traditionally, all agricultural activities were accounted for at historical cost. As a result, gains were accounted for only on the sale of agricultural produce to a customer. There was a lot of diversity in accounting for agricultural activities, as assets related to agricultural activities and changes in those assets were excluded from the scope of international accounting standards.</p>
<p>In 1994, the IASC Board decided to develop an international accounting standard on agriculture, with the aim of reducing this diversity. There was a greater need of financial statements based on <span class="bold">sound and generally acceptable principles. </span>Since the use of a historic cost model was not seen as wholly appropriate for accounting for agricultural activity, the Board issued IAS 41 based on a fair value model.</p>
<p>Moreover, most business organisations involved in agricultural activity are generally small, cash-oriented and family-oriented. These small agricultural entities also seek outside capital and subsidies, mainly from banks or government agencies and are required to produce financial statements. These financial statements are required to be based on generally acceptable and sound accounting principles.</p>
<p>In this Study Guide, we shall try to understand the underlying accounting principles to be used, while preparing the financial statements of such organisations that are involved in agricultural activities. The understanding of these accounting principles will not only be of help during your examinations but will also be of immense help in your future professional life.</p>
<p>On completion of the Study Guide, you will also be able to:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Understand the difference between biological assets and agricultural produce.</li>
<li>Learn how to measure biological assets and agricultural produce.</li>
<li>Deal with gains and losses on biological assets and agricultural produce.</li>
</ul>
