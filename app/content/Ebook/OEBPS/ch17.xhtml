<p class="ct"><span class="bold">1. The structure and content of statement of financial position, statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.1 Components of financial statements</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A complete set of financial statements comprises of:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a statement of financial position as at end of the period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>a statement of changes in equity for the period</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>a statement of cash flow for the period;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">e) </span>notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">f) </span>comparative information in respect of the preceding period (at least one year`s comparative financial statements); and</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">g) </span>a statement of financial position as at the beginning of the preceding period when an entity applies an accounting policy retrospectively or makes a retrospective restatement of items in its financial statements, or when it reclassifies items in its financial statements</p>
</div>
<p>The entity shall give equal prominence to all the components of financial statements. A complete set of financial statements includes all the above components.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Purpose</span></p>
<p>General purpose financial statements meet the needs of users who are not in a position to demand reports tailored to meet their particular information needs.</p>
<p>As you have seen earlier, the objective of general purpose financial statements is to provide information about the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. The information contained in the statements is used by a wide range of users in making economic decisions.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Investors may use the statements to decide about investing in the company or divesting their shares. Banks may use them to decide about whether to lend to the entity or not. Governments may levy taxes based on the statements and so on.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Objective of financial statements</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/256-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Two types of disclosures</span></p>
<p>IAS 1 requires:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Particular disclosures <span class="bold">in </span>the SOFP, SOPL and other comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity; and</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Other disclosures <span class="bold">either in </span>the SOFP, SOPL and other comprehensive income and statement of changes in equity <span class="bold">or in the notes.</span></p>
<p>There are some requirements for disclosures in IAS 1 or other standards without specific reference to either of the above types. For such disclosures, rule 2 above is to be followed i.e. they are to be disclosed at either point.</p>
<p><span class="bold">In simple terms, unless there is a specific requirement to disclose the item in SOFP, SOPL and other comprehensive income or statement of changes in equity, the disclosures can be made either in these statements or in the notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">Identification</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The financial statements should be identified <span class="bold">clearly and distinguished </span>from other information in the same published document.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span><span class="bold">Each component </span>of the financial statement <span class="bold">should be identified.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">The title (e.g. &#x2018;Statement of comprehensive income&#x2019;, &#x2019;Statement of financial position&#x2019; should be clearly given at the top of the page).</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The following information is to be displayed prominently and repeated when necessary</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span><span class="bold">Name </span>of the reporting entity or any other means of identification (e.g. logo), and any changes therein from the end of preceding period.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Whether the statements cover an <span class="bold">individual entity or group of entities.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The end date of the end of the reporting period or period covered by financial statements.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span><span class="bold">Presentation currency </span>(e.g. Euro, US$).</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span><span class="bold">Level of rounding </span>off used in presenting amounts (e.g. to the nearest thousand).</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">When the report is in a physical printed form, the above information can be included as titles on each page.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">The period to be covered</span></p>
<p>The financial statements are to be presented <span class="bold">at least annually.</span> If the reporting date is changed, and the financial statements are presented for a period <span class="bold">longer or shorter than one year,</span> they should disclose:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>The <span class="bold">reasons for using a longer or shorter period.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>The fact that the amounts presented in financial statements are <span class="bold">not entirely comparable </span>as they have been prepared for periods with varying lengths.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Allen Co normally presents its financial statements to 31 December each year. The last set of statements was prepared for the year ended 31 December 20X5.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Local laws were amended in 20X6 to require all entities to follow a uniform accounting year ending on 31 March.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Allen will prepare its next financial statements for the period from 1 January 20X6 to 31 March 20X7, and will disclose in the financial statements the fact that the end of the reporting period is of 15 months.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.4 Statement of financial position: current / non-current distinction</span></p>
<p>Traditionally, accountants have arranged the assets and liabilities of an entity either on the basis of whether they are current or non-current or on the basis of their liquidity.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>IAS 1 gives <span class="bold">first preference to the current / non-current presentation. </span>However, it <span class="bold">permits a presentation based on liquidity </span>if this provides information that is reliable and more relevant.</p>
<p>We will first understand how assets and liabilities are split into current and non-current.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span><span class="bold">Current assets and current liabilities</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">An asset </span>should be <span class="bold">classified as current when it satisfies any </span>of the following criteria:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>It is expected to be realised in, or is intended for sale or consumption in, the entity&#x2019;s normal <span class="bold">operating cycle;</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>It is <span class="bold">held primarily </span>for the purpose of <span class="bold">trading</span>;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>It is expected to be realised <span class="bold">within twelve months </span>after the reporting period; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>It is <span class="bold">cash or a cash equivalent </span>(as defined in IAS 7 Statement of cash flows), unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">All other assets should be classified as non-current.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">A liability </span>should be <span class="bold">classified as current when it satisfies any </span>of the following criteria:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>It is expected to be settled in the entity&#x2019;s normal <span class="bold">operating cycle;</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>It is <span class="bold">held primarily </span>for the purpose of trading;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>It is due to be settled <span class="bold">within twelve months </span>after the reporting period; or</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>The entity does not have an <span class="bold">unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least twelve months </span>after the reporting period.</p>
<p class="boxpara">All <span class="bold">other liabilities </span>should be classified as <span class="bold">non-current.</span></p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>The point to be noted is that if <span class="bold">any ONE of the criteria </span>is satisfied, the asset or liability is &#x201C;current&#x201D;.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>If we study the above definitions, we find a general theme: current assets and liabilities are respectively those assets and liabilities which are expected to be realised and settled in the entity&#x2019;s <span class="bold">normal trading cycle </span>or in the near future, for example <span class="bold">within the next twelve months.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Trade receivables, inventories are current assets, but buildings and machines are non-current assets. This is because trade receivables are likely to be settled within 3 months: and most entities like to turn over their inventory as quickly as possible, preferably within one year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Similarly, trade payables, bills payables are current liabilities, whereas debentures issued are non-current liabilities. This is because trade payables are usually settled within 3 months, but debentures are often repaid years later.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.5 Information to be presented in the Statement of financial position</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>After studying the methods of classification, it is now essential to see which items must be disclosed in the statement of financial position. It is to be noted that these items can be classified by using either of the methods discussed above.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">As a minimum, the face of the statement of financial position should include line items that present the following amounts:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Property, plant and equipment;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Investment property;</p>

<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">l) </span>Provisions;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">m) </span>Financial liabilities (excluding amounts shown under (j) and (k));</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">n) </span>Liabilities and assets for current tax, as defined in IAS 12 Income Taxes;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">o) </span>Deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets, as defined in IAS 12;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">p) </span>Non-controlling interest, presented within equity; and</p>

<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span><span class="bold">Held for sale and disposal groups:</span> the following items are also to be disclosed in the statement of financial position</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the total of assets classified as held for sale and assets included in disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5;</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb1">b) </span>liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span><span class="bold">Additional line items, headings and subtotals: </span>when relevant to an understanding of the entity&#x2019;s financial position, additional line items, headings and subtotals may be presented in the statement of financial position.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.9 Information to be presented in the statement of change in equity</span></p>
<p>Though this portion does not form part of this Learning objective or your syllabus, information related to presentation of statement of change in equity will be of great help while understanding other topics<span class="bold">.</span></p>
<p>Before we go into the contents and purpose of a statement of changes in equity, let us first understand the meaning of and link between equity, and the concept of comprehensive income.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Equity </span>is the residual interest in the assets of the entity after deducting all its liabilities.</p>
<!--<p><span class="bold">The Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, Para 4.4</span></p>-->
</div>
<p>In other words, equity is the excess of the value of assets over the value of liabilities. It therefore includes all funds belonging to the owners of the entity e.g. capital, reserves, and retained earnings.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Comprehensive income is the change in equity </span>of a business enterprise during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources. It includes all changes in equity during a period except those resulting from investments by owners and distributions to owners&#x201D;</p>
<!--<p><span class="bold">Concept statement 6 issued by FASB</span></p>-->
</div>
<p>Thus, comprehensive income is:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the change in equity (assets minus liabilities) during the period</li>
<li>due to transactions and other events and circumstances from non-owner sources</li>
</ul>
<p>The effect of owner related transactions is to be eliminated (e.g. investments by owners or distributions to owners.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.10 Statement of changes in equity</span></p>
<p>The statement of changes in equity presents all changes in all components of equity.</p>
<p>IAS 1 stipulates that certain details are to be disclosed in the statement of changes in equity, whereas others are to be disclosed either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity shall show the following <span class="bold">in the statement of changes in equity:</span></p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the total amounts attributable to owners of the parent and to non-controlling interest;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>For each component of equity, the effects of retrospective application or retrospective restatement recognised in accordance with IAS 8.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>For each component of equity, reconciliation between the carrying amount at the beginning and the end of the period, separately disclosing changes resulting from:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>profit or loss;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>each item of other comprehensive income: and</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">iii. </span>transactions with owners in their capacity as owners, showing separately contributions by and distributions to owners and changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control</p>
</div>
<p>The statement of changes in equity presents all changes in all components of equity. Components of equity include each class of contributed equity, the accumulated balance of each class of other comprehensive income and retained earnings.</p>
<p>IAS 1 requires an entity to present dividends recognised as distributions to owners during the period and related amounts per share in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.11 Possible reasons for changes in equity are:</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>profit or loss for the period;</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>other comprehensive income during the period; and</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span><span class="bold">other transactions </span>between the entity and the shareholders or owners (for example, equity contributions and withdrawals, buyback of shares, dividends distributed, and the transaction costs directly related to such transactions).</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">2. Accounting for non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations.</span></p>
<p>IFRS 5 specifies the accounting for assets held for sale and the presentation and disclosure of discontinued operations. IFRS 5 is applicable for all non-current assets held for sale and to groups of assets and associated liabilities which will be disposed of in a single transaction, described as a disposal group.</p>
<p>However IFRS 5 is not applicable in case of those assets which are to be measured in accordance with other accounting standards like deferred tax asset accounted according to IAS 12, financial assets measured per IFRS 9 etc.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.1 Non-current assets held for sale</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An entity shall classify a non-current asset (or disposal group) as held for sale if its carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.</p>
</div>
<p>For classification of non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for sale , the asset must be available for sale immediately in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets and the sale should be highly probable</p>
<p>For the sale to be highly probable, the following conditions are to be satisfied:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The management should commit to a plan to sell the asset (or disposal group) and actively search for a buyer. Further, the asset (or disposal group) must be actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>An exchange transaction qualifies as a sale, when the exchange has commercial substance. However, the exchange has to be of non-current assets for other non-current assets.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>After classification as held for sale the asset has to be sold within one year. The one year period may be extended if the events or circumstances occur which are beyond the entity&#x2019;s control. An entity may classify a newly acquired non-current asset as an asset held for sale on the date of its acquisition.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">d) </span>A newly acquired asset may be classified as held for sale on its acquisition date even when the entity does not satisfy the conditions a) and b) but those conditions have to be satisfied within a short period (usually three months) following the acquisition.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">e) </span>The conditions for classification of assets as held for sale need to be satisfied before the end of the reporting period, in order to classify the asset as held for sale in the statement of financial position. However, if the conditions are met after the end of the reporting period but before the financial statements are authorised for issue, the information should be disclosed.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.2 Discontinued operations</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A discontinued operation is a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale, and:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>represents either a separate major line of business or a geographical area of operations, and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>is part of a single co-ordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, or</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">c) </span>is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale and the disposal involves loss of control.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Samson Plc is engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling electronic goods as well as cosmetics. Both the lines of business are recognised as different segments for financial reporting purpose and results of these components are separately analysed by the management.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Management of Samson Plc plans to focus on their core competencies and dispose cosmetics segment. Cosmetics segment will be classified and reported as a discontinued operation, separately from continuing operations as it meets all the requirements of discontinued operations.</p>
</div>
<p>The objective of the disclosures required by IFRS 5 is to provide users of the financial statements with sufficient information so that they are able to evaluate the financial effect of discontinued operations. Entity is required to provide following disclosures in case of discontinued operations:</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.3 Presentation in the statement of profit or loss</span></p>
<p>IFRS 5 requires an entity to present in its statement of statement of profit or loss a single amount comprising the total of:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">i. </span>the post-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>the post-tax gain or loss recognised on the measurement of the assets or disposal group(s) to fair value less cost of disposal.</p>
<p>In addition, to this disclosure the single amount mentioned needs to be analysed in the notes to accounts or in the statement of profit or loss. The following details needs to be disclosed</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>the revenue, expenses and pre-tax profit or loss of discontinued operations;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>the related income tax expense as required by IAS 12;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">c) </span>the gain or loss recognised on the measurement to fair value less cost of disposal or on the disposal of the assets or disposal group(s) constituting the discontinued operation; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">d) </span>the related income tax expense</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">2.4 Changes to a plan of sale</span></p>
<p>Sometimes an entity may change its plan for sale and so a component may cease to be qualified as held for sale. When this reclassification occurs, the results of that component need to be reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations. This needs to be done for both current and prior periods. The prior period amounts should be described as having been re-presented.</p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. The content and form of interim financial statements.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">IAS 34,</span> Interim Financial Reporting, lays down the requirements about the content and form of interim financial statements.</p>
<p><span class="bold">What is an interim financial statement?</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">Interim period is a financial reporting period shorter than a full financial year.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Interim financial report means a financial report containing either a complete set of financial statements (as described in IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007)) or a set of condensed financial statements (as described in this Standard) for an interim period.</p>
</div>
<p>If an entity publishes a complete set of financial statements in its interim financial report, the form and content of those statements should conform to IAS 1 for a complete set of financial statements. <span class="bold">In this Study Guide, we concentrate on the condensed financial statements.</span></p>

The size or nature of the item, or a combination of both, could be the determining factor.</p>
<p>Materiality is considered in deciding how to recognise measure, classify, or disclose an item for interim financial reporting purposes.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. IAS 29 financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies.</span></p>
<p>The objective of IAS 29 &#x2018;Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies&#x2019; is to establish specific standards for entities reporting in the currency of a hyperinflationary economy, so that the financial information provided is meaningful. IAS 29 requires financial statements of entities operating in hyperinflationary economies to be restated in terms of a current measurement at the reporting date.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Scope of IAS 29</span></p>
<p>Hyperinflation is indicated by characteristics of the economic environment of a country which include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(a) </span>the general population prefers to keep its wealth in non-monetary assets or in a relatively stable foreign currency. Amounts of local currency held are immediately invested to maintain purchasing power;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(b) </span>the general population regards monetary amounts not in terms of the local currency but in terms of a relatively stable foreign currency. Prices may be quoted in that currency;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(c) </span>sales and purchases on credit take place at prices that compensate for the expected loss of purchasing power during the credit period, even if the period is short;</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(d) </span>interest rates, wages and prices are linked to a price index; and</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">(e) </span>the cumulative inflation rate over three years is approaching, or exceeds, 100%</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 Restatement of financial statements in hyperinflationary economies</span></p>
<p>The financial statements of an entity whose functional currency is the currency of a hyperinflationary economy are stated in terms of the measuring unit current at the end of the reporting period. Corresponding figures in relation to prior periods are also restated. The gain or loss on the net monetary position is included in profit or loss and separately disclosed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">1. Items in the statement of financial position</span></p>
<p>Any non-monetary items are restated by multiplying the original cost (or revalued amount) by a factor:</p>
<p><img src="images/273-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Monetary items are not restated as they are already carried at the current value.</p>
<p><span class="bold">2. Items in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income</span></p>
<p>All items are retranslated by multiplying the original value by a factor:</p>
<p><img src="images/273-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">3. Net monetary gains and losses</span></p>
<p>Although monetary items are not retranslated, there will be an overall gain or loss. If an entity has net monetary assets it will lose, if it has net monetary liabilities it will gain. This net gain or loss must be reported as part of net income.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.3 Economy ceasing to be hyperinflationary economy</span></p>
<p>When an economy ceases to be hyperinflationary and an entity discontinues the preparation and presentation of financial statements prepared in accordance with this Standard, it shall treat the amounts expressed in the measuring unit current at the end of the previous reporting period as the basis for the carrying amounts in its subsequent financial statements.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.4 Disclosure</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Gain or loss on monetary items</li>
<li>The fact that financial statements and other prior period data have been restated for changes in the general purchasing power of the reporting currency</li>
