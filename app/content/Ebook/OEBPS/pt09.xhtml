<p class="h2d"><img src="images/sq1.png" alt=""/> <span class="bold">GET THROUGH INTRO</span></p>
<p>As a finance manager of a large company, you will have to determine which liabilities are to be provided for and reflected in the financial statements of your company. You will also have to identify the contingent liabilities and contingent assets to be disclosed in the notes to the accounts.</p>
<p>Any <span class="bold">error in judgement </span>on your part, besides meaning that the <span class="bold">requirements of IAS 37 have not been fulfilled, </span>would also lead to a <span class="bold">misrepresentation of facts in the financial statements.</span></p>
<p>You should spend time understanding the principles and the underlying determination of liabilities, contingent liabilities and contingent assets. This will not only help you solve the questions in your examination correctly, but will also help you in your future professional life.</p>
