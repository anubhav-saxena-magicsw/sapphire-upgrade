<p>Statements of cash flows are included as a component of financial statements under IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.</p>
<p>Until not many years ago the phrase &#x2018;financial statements&#x2019; indicated mainly the statement of financial position and the statement of profit or loss. However, these two statements by themselves do not give vital information necessary for an understanding of the performance and the health of an entity.</p>
<p>Cash is the lifeline of a business and it is essential that the owners and other users have sufficient information about its movements. Failure to manage cash properly may snap that lifeline, endangering the survival of the business.</p>
<p>In the future, as an accountant, consultant or auditor, you may be called upon to prepare or verify statements of cash flows. Company management or client staff should be able to place their faith in these and take important decisions based on them. This Study Guide helps you to gear up for this challenge.</p>
