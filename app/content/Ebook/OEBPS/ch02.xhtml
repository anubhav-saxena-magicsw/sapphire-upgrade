<p><span class="bold">IFRS 15 Revenue from contract with customers </span>was issued by International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), which replaces the age-old guidance under IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts, IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty programmes, IFRIC 15 Agreement for construction of Real Estate and SIC 31 Revenue Barter Transactions involving Advertising Services. IFRS 15 has consolidated the guidance in various IASB publications under one roof now.</p>

<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.2 Scope of IFRS 15</span></p>
<p>IFRS 15 applies to contracts to deliver goods and services to a customer and will not apply when those contracts are:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Leases &#x2013; covered under IAS 17</li>
<li>Insurance &#x2013; covered under IFRS 4</li>
<li>Rights and obligation which fall within the scope of financial instrument guidance &#x2013; covered under IFRS 9</li>
<li>Rights and obligations which fall within the scope of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures; and</li>
<li>Non-monetary transactions between entities in same line of business where this is done to facilitate sales to customers / potential customers</li>
</ul>
<p>A contract with a customer may partially fall within the scope of IFRS 15 and partially within the scope of other standards discussed above. In such circumstances the following guidance needs to be applied:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">If other standard specifies how to separate </span>- If the other Standards specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then an entity shall first apply the separation and/or measurement requirements in those Standards.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Omega Ltd contracts with a customer to lease an asset and also to provide for its maintenance. The leased asset will be accounted applying the guidance under IAS 17 leases and remaining part of the contract pertaining to maintenance will be accounted as per IFRS 15</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">If other standard does not specify how to separate - </span>If the other Standards do not specify how to separate and/or initially measure one or more parts of the contract, then the entity shall apply this Standard to separate and/or initially measure the part (or parts) of the contract.</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">1.3 Revenue recognition model</span><a href="videos/Revenue Recognition Model.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>IFRS 15 model follows a five-step approach to account for revenue. The guidance under IFRS 15 will be applicable to all sectors and this will replace the separate guidance required for the sale of goods, service contracts and construction contracts. As required by the old guidance under IAS 18 as regards to transfer of the risks and rewards to recognise revenue will no longer be sufficient to recognise revenue. Under IFRS 15, revenue will be recognised when there is a transfer of control.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 1: Five step approach</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/27-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Now let us understand the above five steps in detail:</span><a href="videos/Revenue Recognition_Part2.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Identify the contract with the customer</span></p>
<p>As explained above, a contract is defined under IFRS 15 as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations. An entity shall account for such a contract with a customer that is within the scope of IFRS 15 only when all of the following criteria are met:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Conditions for recognising revenue from contracts</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/27-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>An entity shall recognise the consideration received from any customer as a liability, until the above criteria are subsequently met. The entity shall recognise the consideration received as revenue only when either of the following events has occurred:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the entity has no remaining obligations to transfer goods or services to the customer and all, or substantially all, of the consideration promised by the customer has been received by the entity and is non-refundable; or</li>
<li>the contract has been terminated and the consideration received from the customer is non-refundable.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Contract modification</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A contract modification is a change in the scope or price (or both) of a contract that is approved by the parties to the contract</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes the price or scope of the original contract may be modified. A contract modification that has been approved (i.e. it creates enforceable rights and obligations) shall be accounted as a separate contract if both the following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the scope of the contract increases because of the addition of promised goods or services that are distinct and</li>
<li>the price of the contract increases by an amount of consideration that reflects the entity&#x2019;s stand-alone selling prices of the additional promised goods or services and any appropriate adjustments to that price to reflect the circumstances of the particular contract</li>
</ul>
<p>A contract modification may result in two scenarios:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 3: Contract modifications</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/28-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Note: </span>If the goods and services from the original contract remain unsatisfied on the date when the original contract is modified, then in such a case, the unsatisfied performance obligations along with the new performance obligations in the modified contract have to be accounted as a modified contract only.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p><a href="videos/Case-study.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a>
<p class="boxpara">Mercury Ltd promises to sell 120 guitars to a customer for $12,000 (i.e. $100 per guitar). The guitars are transferred to the customer at various points in time over a six-month period. The contract is modified after 60 guitars have been transferred and Mercury promises to deliver an additional 30 products for an additional $2,850 or $95 per guitar. This means totally 150 guitars will be transferred.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The pricing for the additional guitars reflects the stand-alone selling price of the guitars at the time of the contract modification. In addition, the additional guitars are distinct from the original products because the Mercury regularly sells the guitars separately. Therefore, the contract modification for the additional 30 guitars is, in effect, a new and separate contract. It should not affect the accounting for the existing contract.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In accordance with IFRS 15, if the pricing for the additional guitars did not reflect the stand-alone selling price of the additional guitars, Mercury would allocate the modified transaction price (less the amounts allocated to products transferred at or before the date of the modification) to all remaining guitars to be transferred.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Applying IFRS 15, the amount recognised as revenue for each of the remaining guitars would be a blended price of $98.33 [($100 &#x00D7; 60 products not yet transferred under original contract) + ($95 &#x00D7; 30 products to be transferred under the contract modification)] &#x00F7; 90 remaining products} per product</p>
<p class="right"><span class="bold">(Adaptation of illustrative examples from IFRS 15)</span></p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract</span></p>
<p>Applying IFRS 15, revenue recognition is dependant when an entity satisfies a performance obligation. In order to recognise revenue, proper identification of distinct performance obligation is one of the prime steps towards revenue recognition. This needs to be done at the start of the contract.</p>
<p>In order to be classified as a distinct performance obligation, a contract should be such that the customer can benefit from:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>the good or service separately identifiable and distinct; or</li>
<li>a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">PTC Software sold a software license to one of its clients. The contract with the client states that PTC is to provide software updates and technical support for the next 3 years from the date of sale. The software remains functional without updates and technical support.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case PTC needs to identify distinct performance obligations in order to recognise revenue. The software is delivered to the client before providing updates and technical support and also the customer can benefit from the software distinctly on its own. Also the other parts of the contract requiring technical support and updates are separately identifiable.</p>
<p class="boxpara">On the basis of this evaluation, PTC concludes three performance obligations which are:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Software license</li>
<li>Software updates</li>
<li>Technical support</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Persistent Ltd licences customer relationship management software to a customer. In addition, Persistent promises to provide consulting services to significantly customise the software to the customer&#x2019;s information technology environment for total consideration of $600,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Persistent Ltd is providing a significant service of integrating the goods and services (the licence and the consulting services) into the combined item for which the customer has contracted. In addition, the software is significantly customised by Persistent in accordance with the specifications negotiated with the customer.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, Persistent would account for the licence and consulting services together as one performance obligation. Revenue for that performance obligation would be recognised over time by selecting an appropriate measure of progress towards complete satisfaction of the performance obligation.</p>
<p class="right"><span class="bold">(Adaptation of illustrative examples from IFRS 15)</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Accounting:</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">For distinct goods and services: </span>If an entity promises to transfer more than one good or service, the entity shall account for each promised good or service as a separate performance obligation only if it is distinct.</p>
<p><span class="bold">For bundled goods and services: </span>If a promised good or service is not distinct (bundled), an entity shall combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until the entity identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Brooklyn Ltd, an entity in the construction sector enters into a contract with a client to build a residential bungalow. Brooklyn Ltd is overall responsible for timely completing the project and handing over the possession to its client. Building construction being a complex activity would require various goods and services to be provided which include laying foundation, laying structure, piping, finishing, etc.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case Brooklyn would account for the bundle of goods or services as single performance obligation, because the goods or services are provided as a single bundle and are highly interrelated</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Depending on the contract, promised goods or services may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>sale of goods produced by an entity (for example, inventory of a manufacturer)</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>resale of goods purchased by an entity (for example, merchandise of a retailer)</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>resale of rights to goods or services purchased by an entity</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(iv) </span>granting licenses</p>

<p class="hangR0b"><span class="sb-R">(vi) </span>granting options to purchase additional goods or services</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Determination of transaction price</span></p>
<p>An entity shall consider the terms of the contract and its customary business practices to determine the transaction price.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">transaction price </span>is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties (for example some sales tax.)</p>
</div>
<p>The consideration promised in a contract with a customer may include fixed amounts, variable amounts, or both.</p>
<p>While determining the transaction price, the entity shall consider the effects of all of the following:</p>
<p><span class="bold">(i) Variable consideration</span></p>
<p>An amount of consideration can vary because of discounts, rebates, refunds, credits, price concessions, incentives, performance bonuses, penalties or other similar items. If the promised amount of consideration in a contract is variable due to the factors mentioned, an entity can estimate the transaction price by using either the</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>expected value (that is, probability-weighted amount) or</li>
<li>the most likely amount,</li>
</ul>
<p>The above depends on which method the entity expects to better predict the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Important</p>
<p class="boxpara">Examples of where a variable consideration can arise</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Discounts</li>
<li>Rebates</li>
<li>Refunds</li>
<li>Credits</li>
<li>Price concessions</li>
<li>Incentives</li>
<li>Performance bonuses</li>
<li>Penalties</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">(ii) Constraining estimates of variable consideration</span></p>
<p>An entity shall include in the transaction price the variable consideration estimated above, only if it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty is resolved.</p>
<p><span class="bold">(iii) Existence of a significant financing component in the contract</span></p>
<p>In determining the transaction price, an entity shall adjust the transaction price for the effects of the time value of money. This will require adjusting the transaction price by discounting it with an appropriate interest rate and recognising the interest income or expense over the financing period. This is <span class="bold">not required </span>if the time period between the transfer of goods of service <span class="bold">is less than one year.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">On 31 March 2007, Delta sold goods for a price of $12∙1 million. The terms of the sale allowed the customer to extend the credit and the price was payable by the customer in cash on 31 March 2009. A discount rate that is appropriate for the risks in this transaction is 10%.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, on 31 March 2007, Delta should recognise only $10 million i.e. [$12.1 million / (1 + 10%)<sup>2</sup>] as revenue and receivables. On 31 March 2008, it should recognise $1 million ($10 million x 10%) as finance cost and increase the receivables. On 31 March 2009, finance cost (income) will be recognised for $1.1 million ($11 million x 10%) and also the receivables.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">(iv) Non-cash consideration</span></p>
<p>Sometimes the customer may pay the consideration in a sales transaction in form other than cash. In such a case the entity shall recognise the non-cash consideration <span class="bold">at fair value.</span></p>
<p>If an entity cannot reasonably estimate the fair value of the non-cash consideration, the entity shall measure the consideration indirectly <span class="bold">by reference to the stand-alone selling price </span>of the goods or services promised to the customer in exchange for the consideration</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Genius Ltd, a company engaged in manufacturing computers and laptops supplied 150 computers to Gemini Ltd under a contract. In accordance with the contract Gemini agreed to pay Genius by transferring the rights to one of its patents. This patent will allow Genius to improve the display quality of its computer screens. The fair value of patents was estimated at $0.5 million. The stand-alone price of each computer is $2,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case Genius will measure the non-cash consideration i.e. patents at $0.5 million. If the fair value of patent was not available, then in such case, the non-cash consideration would be measured at the stand-alone selling price of computers promised i.e. $2,500 x 150 computers = 0.375 million.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">(v) Consideration payable to a customer</span></p>
<p>Consideration payable to a customer includes cash amounts that an entity pays, or expects to pay, to the customer. Consideration payable to a customer also includes credit or other items (for example, a coupon or voucher) that can be applied against amounts owed to the entity (or to other parties that purchase the entity&#x2019;s goods or services from the customer).</p>
<p>An entity shall account for such consideration payable to a customer <span class="bold">as a reduction of the transaction price.</span></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract</span><a href="videos/Revenue Recognition_Part3.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p>For a contract that has more than one separate performance obligation, an entity would allocate the transaction price to each separate performance obligation at an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each separate performance obligation.</p>
<p>To allocate an appropriate amount of consideration to each separate performance obligation, an entity would determine the standalone selling price at contract inception of the good or service underlying each separate performance obligation and allocate the transaction price on a relative standalone selling price basis. If a standalone selling price is not observable, an entity would estimate it.</p>
<p>IFRS 15 also specifies the circumstances in which an entity would allocate a discount or a contingent amount entirely to one (or some) distinct goods or services promised in a contract rather than to all promised goods or services in the contract.</p>
<p>An entity would allocate to the separate performance obligations in a contract any subsequent changes in the transaction price on the same basis as at contract inception. Amounts allocated to a satisfied performance obligation would be recognised as revenue, or as a reduction of revenue, in the period in which the transaction price changes.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Grace Ltd enters into a contract with a customer to sell Products A, B and C for a total transaction price of $36. The entity regularly sells Products A, B and C on a stand-alone basis for the following prices:</p>
<table style="margin-left: 0.5em;" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">

</ul>
<p class="boxpara">Grace Ltd regularly sells Products A and B as a bundle for $16 (i.e. at a $4 discount). Since Grace Ltd regularly sells Products A and B together for $16 and regularly sells Product C for $20, it has observable prices as evidence that the $4 discount in the contract should be allocated only to Products A and B. Hence, Grace Ltd allocates the transaction price of $36 as follows:</p>

<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note:</span> If any of the conditions (for recognising revenue over time) are <span class="bold">NOT </span>met, revenue is recognised at a point of time.</p>
</div>
<p>For a performance obligation satisfied over time, a company would select an appropriate measure of progress to determine how much revenue should be recognised as the performance obligation is satisfied. This is especially applicable in long duration contracts. Methods used to measure over time contracts include:</p>
<p class="hang"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Output methods: </span>This includes surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, units produced/delivered etc.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A report of an expert, given after surveying the work, states the work is 45% complete.</p>
<p class="boxpara">45% would be used for percentage completed.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A record of physical progress e.g. cubic metres of work done can be referred to for finding out the proportion of performance obligation satisfied over time.</p>
<p class="boxpara">If 6,000 cubic metres out of 10,000 have been completed, it can be said that 60% of that activity is completed.</p>
</div>

<div class="tip">
<p class="boxtitle">Tip</p>
<p>If the entity&#x2019;s efforts or inputs are expended evenly throughout the performance period, it may be appropriate for the entity to recognise revenue on a straight-line basis.</p>
<p>The entity needs to consider various aspects before selecting an appropriate method; a biased approach towards selection of the appropriate method can result in unreliable financial statements.</p>
<p>Example: if a contract includes manufacturing 20 distinct products of which 18 products constituting 30% of the total expected cost are completed, the output method might lead to a misleading picture and non-compliance with matching principle.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Specific guidance is provided in relation to revenue arising from provision of licence related to intellectual properties (Patents, Softwares etc.)</span></p>
<p>In case of revenue arising from such license:</p>

<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>When the entity retains an <span class="bold">obligation for unsatisfactory performance </span>not covered by normal warranty provisions</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Perfect Co is a manufacturer of stereos and offers a warranty of a &#x2018;six months free repair period&#x2019; for all its models. However a manufacturing defect is revealed in the model 234 and Perfect Co has declared that it will refund the money for the model even after the warranty period is over, but before one year from sale.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">What should be the accounting treatment?</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, for model 234, the risk of ownership remains with Perfect Co till the end of one year from the date of sale. This is because the customers have an option to return the product within one year from the date of sale. Therefore Perfect Co should not recognise revenue from the sale of Model 234.The revenue will be recognised only after one year from the date of sale, if the goods are not returned by the customers.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>When the <span class="bold">receipt of revenue from a particular sale is contingent </span>on the receiving of revenue by the buyer from its sale further on of the goods;</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Generally, in the case of car dealerships, the dealer takes cars from the manufacturer on consignment. In some agreements, payment is not made from the dealership (consignee) to the manufacturer (consignor) until the dealer sells the car on to a third party. The dealer often has the right to return cars to the manufacturer if they are not sold within a specified period of time.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>When the goods are shipped subject to installation and the installation is <span class="bold">a significant part of the contract which has not yet been completed </span>by the entity;</p>

<p class="boxpara">Heavy Machines Ltd cannot recognise this sale as revenue until it completes the installation of this machine in the premises of Superfine Polyesters.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>When the buyer <span class="bold">has the right to cancel the purchase </span>for a reason specified in the sales contract and the entity is uncertain about the probability of return.</p>

<p>Any replacement of the damaged goods during the warranty period by the company is not recognised as revenue because of the following reasons:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>revenue was already recognised during the sale of the original stock of goods</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>there is no consideration received by the entity for the damaged goods</p>

<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Maxcare Inc entered into a contract with one of its customers to sell a machine and provide free servicing for the next three years.

<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Identify the contract</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">A contract can be in any form; here the contract between Maxcare Inc and its customer is related to the sale of machine and servicing, and is for three years.</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Identify the performance obligation</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">According to the contract, there are two contractual obligations arising in this case: a) obligation to deliver the machine; and b) obligation to provide servicing for the next three years.</p>

The transaction price of $6,000 will be allocated to each obligation which forms a part of this contract. The transaction price to be allocated to the delivery of the machine is $4,138 ($6,000 x $5,000/$7,250) and the transaction price to be allocated to the servicing obligation is $1,862 ($6,000 x $2,250/$7,250).</p>

<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">i. </span>For the first performance obligation, the control is transferred at the point of time when risk and rewards and legal title is transferred; hence, revenue of $4,138 from the sale of the machine is recognised immediately.</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">ii. </span>For the servicing obligation, benefits are provided over time, so the revenue shall also be recognised over a period of time i.e. $620.67 ($1,862/3) per year.</p>

<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">The <span class="bold">incremental costs of obtaining a contract </span>are those costs that an entity incurs in its efforts to obtain a contract with a customer and that it would not have been incurred if the contract had not been obtained (for example a sales commission).</p>
</div>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 5: Treatment of incremental costs</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/37-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>As a practical expedient, an entity may recognise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortisation period of the asset that the entity otherwise would have been recognised is 1 year or less.</p>
<p>If the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer are in the scope of another IFRS (for example, IAS 2, IAS 16 or IAS 38), an entity shall account for those costs in accordance with those other IFRSs. Otherwise, an entity shall recognise an asset from the costs to fulfil a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria :</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The <span class="bold">costs relate directly to a contract </span>or to an anticipated contract that the entity can specifically identify. For example cost of material, labour, designing an asset to be transferred under a specific contract (discussed below)</li>
<li>The <span class="bold">costs generate or enhance resources </span>of the entity that will be used to satisfy performance obligations in the future; and</li>
<li>The entity <span class="bold">expects to recover the costs</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Costs that relate directly to a contract (or a specific anticipated contract) include the following:</p>

<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>General and administrative costs </span>(unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer under the contract);</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>Costs of wasted materials, labour </span>or other resources to fulfil the contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract;</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>Costs that relate to satisfied performance obligations </span>(or partially satisfied performance obligations) in the contract (i.e., costs that relate to a past performance); and</p>

<p>If an entity identifies a significant change to the expected pattern of transfer, it updates its amortisation to reflect that change in estimate in accordance with IAS 8.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">ACS Ltd enters into a contract to outsource a customer&#x2019;s information technology data centre for five years.

</div>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. Prepare financial statements extracts for contracts where performance obligations are satisfied over time.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 Rules of recognition</span></p>
<p>For contracts where performance obligations are satisfied over time revenue is recognised based on calculation of progress made towards complete satisfaction of performance obligation in short, proportion of contractual obligation satisfied. These are mostly construction contracts that take substantial period of time to get complete and also meet the criteria that establish that control is transferred over a period of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Once it is established that control is transferred over time the entity needs to measure the progress to satisfaction of the performance obligation arising from the contract by using any of the methods prescribed i.e. input method or output method (We have already covered these in Learning Outcome 2). Once this calculation is done both the revenue recognition and amortisation of capitalised cost of contract is done in a manner consistent with the pattern of transfer of goods or services.</p>
<p>Long term contracts are subject to some uncertainties that are not applicable to other transactions. Recognition of revenues and expenses depends on whether the <span class="bold">outcome of a performance obligation can be estimated reliably.</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the <span class="bold">rules of recognition </span>are divided between the following <span class="bold">two classes:</span></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>When the outcome of a performance obligation <span class="bold">can be estimated reliably.</span></li>
<li>When the outcome of a performance obligation <span class="bold">cannot be estimated reliably.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These are discussed in detail below:</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. When the outcome of a performance obligation can be estimated reliably</span></p>
<p>Recognition of profits will be the result of recognising the contract revenues and costs. Both revenue and costs are recognised in a manner consistent with the pattern of transfer of goods or services to which the capitalised costs relate. The revenue is calculated using the transaction price that is allocated to the performance obligation after considering the variation, credit risks and other factors which impact transaction price. An expected loss on the contract shall be <span class="bold">recognised as an expense </span>immediately using the basis for onerous contracts as specified in IAS 37. Thus in the case of loss making contract only unavoidable costs are considered and the loss is recognised immediately as an expense in SOPL.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Golden Construction Co is executing a contract worth $15m. The <span class="bold">outcome </span>of this contract <span class="bold">can be estimated reliably. </span>On 31 December 20X6 (its end of the reporting period), it estimates that 50% of obligation have been satisfied.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">It will recognise 50% of the expected transaction price as revenues and 50% of contract cost related to the contract in SOPL.</span></p>
</div>
<p>The entity keeps track of the progress of work as well as the cost of the work done. When it is <span class="bold">probable that total costs will exceed total revenue after considering the impact of impairment and credit risk if any,</span> this indicates that there is likely to be an overall loss. Such a loss is to be <span class="bold">recognised immediately as per IAS 37, although IFRS 15 do not prescribe any specific treatment.</span></p>
<p>The <span class="bold">loss </span>is determined and <span class="bold">recognised irrespective of </span>the following:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Whether the contract work has commenced or not.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The proportion of performance obligation satisfied over time.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>The amount of profit expected to arise on other contracts not part of this single contract or other contractual obligation which is a part of same contract.</p>
<p>In case of expected loss, the contract revenue and contract cost to be recognised in the SOPL are to be calculated in the following manner:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The revenue to be recognised is based on the proportion of transfer of control and satisfaction of contractual obligation.</li>
<li>The losses are to be recognised to the fullest (i.e. 100% of the expected losses) based on unavoidable costs.</li>
<li>Hence the contract cost to be recognised needs to be adjusted &#x2013; it is the balancing figure (revenue recognised + expected losses).</li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A company has entered into contract to construct a customised machine for one of its customer. The company estimates that at-least 3 years would be required to complete the assignment. It expects to incur a future loss of $100,000 on this contract.</p>
<p class="boxpara">It cannot avoid recognising the loss of $100,000 on this contract, even though the expected loss is much lower than the expected profits from other contracts. Therefore, the loss of $100,000 should be recognised immediately.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. When the outcome of a performance obligation cannot be estimated reliably:</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Revenue shall be recognised only to the extent that the <span class="bold">contract costs incurred are probably recoverable.</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Contract <span class="bold">costs </span>shall be <span class="bold">recognised as expenses </span>in the period in which they are incurred.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>An <span class="bold">expected loss </span>on the contract shall be <span class="bold">recognised as an expense </span>immediately.</p>
<p>If all the costs incurred are likely to be recovered, then the net income will be zero. This is because the revenue recognised will be equal to the costs incurred.</p>
<p>During the early stages of the contract, the outcome cannot be estimated reliably. However, it may be possible to recover the costs incurred.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Continuing the example of Golden Construction</span></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Assume that the </span>outcome <span class="bold">of this contract </span>cannot be estimated reliably. <span class="bold">On 31 December 20X6, Golden had incurred costs of $6.2m. It expects to recover $5.9m of this cost.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Golden should recognise the <span class="bold">cost of $6.2m </span>and <span class="bold">revenue of $5.9 only. </span>Therefore, a loss of $0.3m will be shown in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.2 Progress billing (amounts Invoiced over a period of time)</span></p>
<p>Progress billing is the amount that is billed by the contractor for work performed. It may or may not have been paid by the customer by the end of the reporting period. The part not collected by the end of the reporting period is an asset similar to receivables.</p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.3 Retentions</span></p>
<p>Out of the progress billings, depending on the agreement, the customer while paying the amount holds some part back. This amount is known as retention<span class="bold">. </span>It is not paid until certain conditions specified in the contract are satisfied or any defects noticed have been rectified.</p>
<p>At times, a period may be specified in the agreement for which the retentions will be held back. Retentions are <span class="bold">amounts retained </span>by the customer, and therefore, <span class="bold">assets for the contractor.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.4 Advances</span></p>
<p>That part of the collection from the customer which is received <span class="bold">before </span>the work is performed is known as an <span class="bold">advance. </span>This amount is a liability for the contractor.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Spillburg Enterprises is carrying out a contract. It raised progress billings worth $600,000 on customer no. 1. The customer paid $540,000 after deducting 10% of the amount to be held as retention for 1 year. Customer no. 2 paid $50,000 for an activity not yet commenced.</p>

<p class="ct"><span class="bold">4. Specific guidance under IFRS 15 for:</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>Principal versus agent</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>Sale with a right of return</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>Bill and hold arrangements</span></p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="bold"><span class="sb-R">(iv) </span>Consignment arrangements</span><a href="videos/Revenue Recognition_Part4.mp4" target="_blank"><img class="Animation_pos_1" title="Animation" src="images/icon/animation.png"/></a></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.1 Principal versus agent</span></p>
<p>In principal-agent relationship, the agent only acts for and on behalf of the principal. Therefore the control of the goods and service is primarily with the principal who bears significant risks and rewards associated with the sale of goods or the rendering of services. The agent merely follows principal&#x2019;s terms and conditions and assumes an obligation of duties towards the principal.</p>
<p>The entity must determine whether its performance obligation is to provide the good or service itself (i.e., the entity is a principal) or to arrange for another party to provide the good or service (i.e., the entity is an agent). This information is crucial for the revenue recognition.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Indicators to identify a principal</span></p>
<p>An entity is a principal if the entity:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>controls a promised good or service before the entity transfers the good or service to a customer.</li>
<li>satisfies the performance obligation by itself or it may engage another party (for example, a subcontractor) to satisfy some or all of a performance obligation on its behalf.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Indicators to determine whether an entity is an agent:</span></p>
<p>An entity is an agent if the entity&#x2019;s performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of goods or services by another party.</p>
<p>Indicators that an entity is an agent (and therefore does not control the good or service before it is provided to a customer) include the following:</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 6: Indicators to determine whether an entity is an agent</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/45-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<ul class="arr">
<li><span class="bold">If the entity is the principal in the arrangement: </span>The revenue is recognised at the gross amount to which the entity expects to be entitled.</li>
<li><span class="bold">If the entity is the agent: </span>The revenue recognised is the net amount the entity is entitled to retain in return for its services as the agent. In such a case the entity&#x2019;s fee or commission may be the net amount of consideration that the entity retains after paying the other party the consideration received in exchange for the goods or services to be provided by that party</li>
</ul>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.2 Sale with a right of return</span></p>
<p>In some contracts, an entity transfers control of a product to a customer and also grants the customer the right to return the product for various reasons (such as dissatisfaction with the product) and receive any combination of the following:</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>a full or partial refund of any consideration paid;</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>a credit that can be applied against amounts owed, or that will be owed, to the entity; and</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>another product in exchange</p>
<p><span class="bold">Accounting for sale with a right of return</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">An entity shall recognise all of the following:</span></p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 7: Accounting for sales with a right of return</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/46-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Bookkart Ltd sells 100 books for $100 each. As per the customary business practice Bookkart allows a customer the right to return any unused product within 30 days and receive a full refund. The cost of each book is $60.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Using the most likely amount, the Bookkart estimates that three books will be returned by the customer. Bookkart&#x2019;s experience is predictive of the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. Further Bookkart estimates that the costs of recovering the books will be immaterial and expects that the returned books can be resold at a profit.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Upon transfer of control of the books, Bookkart would not recognise revenue for the three books that it expects to be returned. Consequently, it would recognise the following:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">a) </span>Revenue </span>of $9,700 ($100 &#x00D7; 97 books expected not to be returned).</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">b) </span>A refund liability </span>for $300 ($100 refund &#x00D7; 3 books expected to be returned).</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="bold"><span class="sb1">c) </span>An asset </span>of $180 ($60 &#x00D7; 3 books) for its right to recover books from customers on settling the refund liability.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Hence, the amount recognised in cost of sales for 97 books is $5,820 ($60 &#x00D7; 97 books).</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.3 Bill and hold arrangements</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A bill-and-hold arrangement is a contract under which an entity bills a customer for a product but the entity retains physical possession of the product until it is transferred to the customer at a point in time in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">A customer may request an entity to enter into such bill and hold contract because of the customer&#x2019;s lack of available space for the product or because of delays in the customer&#x2019;s production schedules.</p>
</div>
<p>In bill and hold arrangement the entity does not control the product and merely custodial services to the customer. Therefore sales revenue <span class="bold">is recognised </span>as soon as the goods are invoiced i.e. when the buyer takes control of the goods. Further all of the following criteria need to be met in order to treat the contract as bill and hold sales</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>The reason for the bill-and-hold arrangement must be substantive (for example, the customer has requested the arrangement);</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>The product must be identified separately as belonging to the customer;</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>The product currently must be ready for physical transfer to the customer; and</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(iv) </span>The entity cannot have the ability to use the product or to direct it to another customer.</p>
<p>Sales revenue is <span class="bold">not recognised </span>when there is simply an intention to acquire or manufacture the goods in time for delivery.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Lolo has entered into an agreement to supply 10 computers worth $30,000 to Bebo. Bebo has made the payment but as her office is under renovation she has asked Lolo not to deliver the computers until further instructions.</p>
<p class="boxpara">This is a bill and hold arrangement.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case Lolo can recognise the revenue as the control of the computers has passed to the Bebo. Further the following conditions are also met:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The bill and hold arrangement is at the request of Bebo</li>
<li>The computers are identified separately belonging to Bebo</li>
<li>The computers are ready for delivery and Lolo is only waiting for instructions from Bebo to deliver the computers.</li>
<li>Lolo cannot transfer these computers to another customer or use it in any other manner.</li>
</ul>
<p class="boxpara">However if Lolo dispatches these computers (identified for Bebo) to some other person then the amount received cannot be recognised as revenue.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.4 Consignment arrangements</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A &#x2018;consignment sale&#x2019; is a transaction where one entity (the consignor) sells goods to another entity (the consignee). The consignee has the option of returning any unsold goods at the end of time period specified in the contract.</p>
</div>
<p class="boxpara">Further other indications of consignment arrangement include:</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>The product is controlled by the entity.</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>The entity can direct the consignee to return the goods back or transfer to another dealer</p>
<p class="hangR"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>The consignee / dealer does not have an obligation to pay for the product (though some deposit money may be collected from such consignors)</p>
<p>When an entity delivers a product to another party (such as a dealer or a distributor) for sale to end customers, the entity shall not recognise revenue as the other party has not obtained control over such goods delivered.</p>
<p>In this case <span class="bold">sales revenue </span>is <span class="bold">recognised by the consignor </span>when the consignee <span class="bold">sells the goods to a third party.</span> Any unsold goods held by the consignee are reflected as an asset in the statement of financial position as inventory with consignee.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Rain Co sells goods amounting to $25,000 on a consignment basis to Gain Co. During the year, Gain Co sold goods amounting to $15,000 to retail dealers.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">The question is now how will Rain Co treat the transaction in its books of accounts?</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Rain Co will recognise $15,000 as sale revenue in the statement of profit or loss to the extent of the retail dealers obtaining control over the goods sold.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The remaining $10,000 ($25,000 - $15,000) is recognised in the statement of financial position as consignment inventory at cost with Gain Co. This is because sales revenue is recognised by the consignor when the consignee sells the goods to third party.</p>
</div>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">4.5 Additional indicators of control</span></p>
<p>The following are the circumstances when the entity has not passed the control in the goods and services to the buyer.</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>When the entity retains an <span class="bold">obligation for unsatisfactory performance </span>not covered by normal warranty provisions</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Perfect Co is a manufacturer of stereos and offers a warranty of a &#x2018;six months free repair period&#x2019; for all its models. However a manufacturing defect is revealed in the model 234 and Perfect Co has declared that it will refund the money for the model even after the warranty period is over, but before one year from sale.</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">What should be the accounting treatment?</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, for model 234, the risk of ownership remains with Perfect Co till the end of one year from the date of sale. This is because the customers have an option to return the product within one year from the date of sale. Therefore Perfect Co should not recognise revenue from the sale of Model 234.The revenue will be recognised only after one year from the date of sale, if the goods are not returned by the customers.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>When the <span class="bold">receipt of revenue from a particular sale is contingent </span>on the receiving of revenue by the buyer from its sale further on of the goods;</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Generally, in the case of car dealerships, the dealer takes cars from the manufacturer on consignment. In some agreements, payment is not made from the dealership (consignee) to the manufacturer (consignor) until the dealer sells the car on to a third party. The dealer often has the right to return cars to the manufacturer if they are not sold within a specified period of time.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">3. </span>When the goods are shipped subject to installation and the installation is <span class="bold">a significant part of the contract which has not yet been completed </span>by the entity;</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Heavy Machines Ltd sells a machine worth $25,000 to Superfine Polyesters. This machine has to be embedded into the ground before it can start manufacturing goods.</p>
<p class="boxpara">Heavy Machines Ltd cannot recognise this sale as revenue until it completes the installation of this machine in the premises of Superfine Polyesters.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">4. </span>When the buyer <span class="bold">has the right to cancel the purchase </span>for a reason specified in the sales contract and the entity is uncertain about the probability of return.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Goods sold on approval basis cannot be recognised until the persons taking the goods have agreed that they want them.</p>
</div>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">5. </span><span class="bold">No recognition of revenue in spite of outflow of inventory</span></p>
<p>Any replacement of the damaged goods during the warranty period by the company is not recognised as revenue because of the following reasons:</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">a) </span>revenue was already recognised during the sale of the original stock of goods</p>
<p class="hang0"><span class="sb1">b) </span>there is no consideration received by the entity for the damaged goods</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Tabitha purchased plastic containers from Solomon worth $6,000. The terms of the sales contract stipulated that in the event of damage to the containers, Solomon would replace the containers free of cost to Tabitha.</p>
<p class="boxpara">On their arrival at Tabitha&#x2019;s 50% of the consignment was damaged. Though Solomon would replace the damaged goods, he could not recognise this outflow of his inventory as revenue.</p>

The transaction includes the impact of the financing arrangement, and the finance cost on the advance received is estimated to be $20. How much revenue shall Textgo Co recognise from this contract on the date of sale when the contract is executed?</p>
<p class="h3a"><span class="bold">Answers to Quick Quiz</span></p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">a) </span>The five steps approach for revenue recognition under IFRS 15 Revenue from contract with customers are:</p>
<p class="hang-a1R"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>Identify the contract with customer</p>
<p class="hang-a1R"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>Identify the performance obligation in contract</p>
<p class="hang-a1R"><span class="sb-R">(iii) </span>Determine the transaction price</p>
<p class="hang-a1R"><span class="sb-R">(iv) </span>Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract</p>
<p class="hang-a1R"><span class="sb-R">(v) </span>Recognise the revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">b) </span>The treatment of incremental costs is as follows:</p>
<p>Under IFRS 15, an entity should capitalise the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if it expects to recover those costs from the customers.</p>
<p>Costs that an entity incurs regardless of whether it obtains a contract are expensed as incurred, unless the costs are explicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the entity obtains the contract.</p>
<p class="hang-a"><span class="sb1">c) </span>Here as Textgo Co has received $230 in advance and the transaction includes the impact of financial arrangement, Textgo needs to consider the impact of the finance cost. Textgo Co shall not recognise any revenue on the date of receipt of advance as performance obligation under the contract is not satisfied.</p>
<p>However, Textgo Co shall recognise the following:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>Contract liability on receipt of advance of $230</li>
<li>Finance cost of $20 on the advance received as it&#x2019;s the finance cost related to the advance received from Mingo Co 12 months before the sale of the machine. It constitutes the cost of using funds which were received in advance.</li>
<li>Revenue on satisfaction of obligation to sell the machine; it will be recognised for $250 including advance of $230 and finance cost of $20.</li>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
