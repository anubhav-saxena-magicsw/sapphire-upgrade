<p>Financial instruments embrace a broad range of assets and liabilities<span class="bold">. </span>They include both&#x2013; financial assets and financial liabilities. This Study Guide discusses the presentation, recognition and measurement aspects of these financial instruments. It explains how a financial asset of one entity immediately gives rise to a financial liability of another entity.</p>
<p>It is essential to understand these concepts clearly because the related accounting standard has given different bases of measurement for different classes of financial assets. Correct classification of financial instruments into debt instruments and equity instruments is also extremely important for the correct assessment of the &#x2018;risk / stability&#x2019; position of a company.</p>
<p>You need to understand these concepts clearly because, as the Finance Manager of a company, you will be required to make these classifications. Any errors of classification of financial instruments on your part will lead to the preparation of an incorrect set of financial statements in real life. It will also lead to a loss of marks in the examination.</p>
