<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An <span class="bold">impairment loss </span>is the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.</p>
</div>
<p>In order to understand the definition of an impairment loss it is necessary to understand the meaning of the following terms.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">An<span class="bold"> asset </span>is a resource controlled by the entity as a result of past events and from which future economic benefits are expected to flow to the entity.</p>
</div>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">A <span class="bold">cash-generating </span>unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.</p>
</div>
<p>This basically means that the entity&#x2019;s assets are broken down into groups of assets. Each of these groups can independently generate cash flows for the entity. This topic will be explained in detail in section 3 of this Study Guide.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Carrying amount </span>is the amount at which an asset is recognised after deducting any accumulated depreciation (amortisation) and accumulated impairment losses thereon.</p>
</div>
<p>The carrying amount of an asset is the <span class="bold">net value of the asset.</span></p>
<p>It is the <span class="bold">residual amount </span>after all <span class="bold">accumulated depreciation, accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses are deducted from the value at which the asset was originally recognised.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Smart had purchased a machine for $500,000 in 20X2. The accumulated depreciation on that machine as on 31 December 20X5 is $150,000.</p>
<p class="boxpara">The carrying amount of the machine as on 31 December 20X5 is:</p>

<p class="image"><img src="images/87-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Fair value less costs to sell</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara">According to<span class="bold"> IAS 1FRS 13 fair value is the </span>price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transactions between market participants at the measurement date.</p>
</div>
<p>The best way to determine the fair value of an asset is by taking the rate at which you could sell the asset to an independent person or entity. When there is no such agreement, then the market value of the asset or the outcome of recent transactions for similar assets within the same industry can be considered as fair value.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">2. Costs to sell include</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) Costs of disposal</span></p>
<div class="definition">

</div>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) Direct incremental costs e.g. </span>of dismantling an asset to bring it to a &#x2018;ready-for-sale&#x2019; condition.</p>
<div class="definition">

<p class="boxpara">Great Co has a machine worth $50,000. This machine is fixed to the ground. The cost of unfastening the machine is $2,500. The fair value of the machine is $40,000.</p>

<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The cost of unfastening the machine ($2,500) is considered to be a cost of disposal because it will not be possible to sell the machine unless it is unsecured from the ground.</p>
</div>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">3. Value in use</span></p>
<p>In order to calculate the value in use of any asset, an entity has to <span class="bold">estimate the future cash flows </span>that it expects to derive from the asset, keeping in mind the <span class="bold">time value of money </span>and the <span class="bold">possible variations </span>in the <span class="bold">amount or timing of those future cash flows. Basically this means that the entity would need to estimate future cash flows and then discount them in order to obtain their value at today&#x2019;s date.</span></p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Definition</p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Value in use </span>is the <span class="bold">present value of the future cash flows </span>expected to be derived from an asset or cash generating unit.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="bold">Measurement and recognition of an impairment loss</span></p>
<p>If the <span class="bold">recoverable amount of an asset is less than its carrying amount,</span> the carrying amount of the asset should be <span class="bold">reduced to its recoverable amount.</span> That reduction is an impairment loss.</p>
<p class="h2"><span class="bold">1. Recognition of an impairment loss</span></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">a) If the asset is not carried at revalued amount</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The impairment loss is to be recognised immediately in the <span class="bold">statement of profit or loss.</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">Journal entries for recording the impairment loss of $1,000 in the above example are:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/88-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="h3"><span class="bold">b) If the asset is carried at revalued amount</span></p>
<p>The impairment loss is recognised in the <span class="bold">statement of other comprehensive income </span>to the extent the impairment loss does not exceed the amount in revaluation surplus for the same asset.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In 20X4, Brand Co revalued a machine that originally cost $30,000 to $40,000. An impairment test conducted in 20X5 leads to an impairment loss of $7,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, the journal entry is:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/88-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
</div>
<p>If the impairment loss is higher than the revaluation surplus, the difference is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In 20X4, Dare Co revalued a machine that originally cost $30,000 to $40,000. An impairment test conducted in 20X5 concludes an impairment loss of $12,500.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, the journal entry is:</p>
<p class="boxpara"><img src="images/88-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p class="boxpara"><span class="bold">Note:</span></p>
<p class="boxpara">The revaluation surplus initially has a credit balance of $10,000 (40,000 &#x2013; 30,000). The impairment loss is higher than this:</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">1. </span>It is recognised against the full amount of the revaluation surplus through the statement of other comprehensive income ($10,000).</p>
<p class="hang0b"><span class="sb1">2. </span>The balance of $2,500 ($12,500 &#x2013; $10,000) is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>

<p>At times a group of assets are linked with each other in such a manner that:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>It is <span class="bold">not possible to ascertain the cash flows to be derived from a single asset.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">Sand Co has a machine which produces 1,000 units of output per day. When Sand requires additional production, it uses an attachment which helps increase the production by 50%. On normal days Sand does not use this attachment.</p>
<p class="boxpara">In this case, it is not possible for Sand to ascertain the cash flows to be derived from the attachment by itself.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li>An individual asset may have a <span class="bold">negligible value in use by itself,</span> but its <span class="bold">value in use could be much higher when considered along with a group of assets.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, if the attachment is not capable of any production by itself, its value in use would be negligible. However, when considered along with the machine, its value in use increases considerably.</p>
</div>
<ul class="arr">
<li>The asset&#x2019;s <span class="bold">value in use cannot be estimated to be close to its fair value less costs to sell.</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="definition">
<p class="boxtitle1">Example</p>
<p class="boxpara">In the above example, if the attachment being used is no longer available in the market, and has no buyers, then its fair value less costs to sell will be negligible. However, the value in use of the attachment for Sand is considerable, especially when considered along with the machine.</p>
</div>
<p>At such times, it becomes necessary to assess whether this whole group of interlinked assets (called a cash-generating unit) have impaired or not.</p>
<p>While identifying a cash-generating unit, it is essential to remember that:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>Cash-generating units <span class="bold">should be capable of generating cash inflows by themselves.</span></p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">2. </span>Cash-generating units should be identified <span class="bold">consistently </span>from period to period for the same asset or types of assets, <span class="bold">unless a change is justified.</span></p>
<p class="ct"><span class="bold">3. The basis on which impairment losses should be allocated, and allocate a given impairment loss to the assets of a cash-generating unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">An impairment loss </span>shall be recognised for a <span class="bold">cash-generating unit </span>if the <span class="bold">recoverable amount of the unit is less than its carrying amount.</span></p>
<p class="h1"><span class="bold">3.1 The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit</span></p>
<p><span class="bold">This </span>is the <span class="bold">higher of the cash-generating unit&#x2019;s fair value, less costs to sell and its value in use. </span>It is determined in the same way as the recoverable amount of an asset.</p>
<p class="caption"><span class="bold">Diagram 2: Recoverable amount of cash generating unit</span></p>
<p class="image"><img src="images/90-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Allocation of an impairment loss</span></p>
<p>The impairment loss will be allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets of the unit in the following order:</p>
<p class="hang-N"><span class="sb-n">1. </span>If it is not practicable to estimate the recoverable amount of each individual asset of a cash-generating unit:</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">a) </span>First, reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash- generating unit.</p>
<p class="hang-a1"><span class="sb1">b) </span>Then (if there remains an unallocated impairment loss) make an arbitrary allocation to the unit&#x2019;s other assets (usually pro rata the carrying amount of each asset in the unit). It is done in this way because all assets of a cash-generating unit work together.</p>
<p>These reductions in the carrying amounts will be treated as impairment losses on individual assets and recognised according to the treatment for impairment of assets.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Question 5</span></p>
<p>In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, which of the following assets must be tested for impairment annually?</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(i) </span>Intangible assets with finite life</p>
<p class="hangR0"><span class="sb-R">(ii) </span>Intangible assets with indefinite life</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 1</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">A.</span></p>
<p>Carrying value at end of 2009 = $400,000 &#x2013; (3 x $40,000) &#x2013; $25,000 = $255,000</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 2</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>Reverse the impairment charge and balance if any is credited to revaluation surplus</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 3</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">D.</span></p>
<p>If the impairment loss is higher than the revaluation surplus, the difference is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 4</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p><img src="images/95-1.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p><span class="bold">Workings</span></p>
<p><img src="images/95-2.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Recoverable amount = higher of fair value and costs to sell and value in use</p>
<p><img src="images/95-3.jpg" alt=""/></p>
<p>Value in use (estimated by management) = $550,000</p>
<p>Therefore recoverable amount = $550,000</p>
<p>Para 6 of IAS 36 defines impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. The same para also defines the recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit as the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Answer to SEQ 5</span></p>
<p>The correct option is <span class="bold">C.</span></p>
<p>An entity should assess for annual impairment at each reporting date the following assets:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>indefinite life intangible assets</li>
<li>goodwill</li>
</ul>
<p>Intangible assets with finite useful life are tested for impairment only when there are indicators of impairment.</p>
