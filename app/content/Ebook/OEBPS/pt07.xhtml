<p>For manufacturing and trading entities, inventories are the <span class="bold">main component </span>of current assets and the working capital cycle. They generate operating profits. Efficient management and reporting of inventories are essential for the correct calculation of profits or losses.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Incorrect figures for inventory can lead to reporting incorrect profits or losses as well as current assets. </span>This may mislead users. Management, taxation authorities, lenders and investors may take wrong decisions if they base their decisions on the wrong figures for profits or losses.</p>
