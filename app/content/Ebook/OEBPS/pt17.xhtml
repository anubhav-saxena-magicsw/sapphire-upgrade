<p>Cooking food well is a job half done. The food will not serve its true purpose unless it is well laid out, to make it appear appetising. Similarly, performing day to day accounting well is a job half done. It will not serve its purpose, unless the results are presented in a proper format, with the required content.</p>
<p>The end result of the accounting process is financial reporting. Unless the report contains true and fair information, and its structure and presentation is understandable and consistent, its utility to the users will be substantially reduced.</p>
<p>Accounting is said to be the language of business. The person receiving the information should understand the statements in the manner the person giving the information intended it to. Similarly, the presenter of the information should give information that is sufficient for the user to make informed decisions.</p>
<p>Unless there are some standards, there may be intentional or unintentional errors in the financial statements. Misleading information will lead to wrong decisions. For example investors may wrongly decide to buy or sell their investments; management may take wrong decisions involving the future of the business.</p>
<p>In future, you will be responsible for ensuring compliance with IFRS, therefore it is essential for you to master the principles.</p>
