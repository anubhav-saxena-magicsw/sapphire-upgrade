<p>Benjamin Franklin once said &#x201C;in this world, nothing is certain but death and taxes&#x201C;! Tax is indeed very certain for most profitable businesses. It is important that you understand how to calculate tax for financial statements, as an incorrect figure could change the meaning of financial statements. Tax reported in financial statements typically comprises not only the amount due for the year being reported (&#x2018;current tax&#x2019;) but also deferred tax.</p>
<p>Deferred tax is actually a very simple concept. For example you record interest income that is due in the current year financial statements. However, you do not actually receive the interest until the following year. You will therefore actually pay tax on the interest in the following year. While recognising the interest income in the current year, you should also recognise the tax that will have to be paid on that income. Deferred tax is a way of ensuring that tax is accounted for on items recognised in the financial statements. It is not a tax that you actually pay it is simply in the financial statements for matching purposes.</p>
<p>This Study Guide will ensure you do not forget about the tax implications of recognising assets and liabilities in the financial statements!</p>
