<p>Financial statements provide information about the financial position and performance of an entity. Financial statements of entities are used widely by different agencies such as stockholders, regulatory agencies, competitors, interested parties and so on. Financial statements enable users to:</p>
<ul class="arr">
<li>compare the financial statements of an entity over time so that trends and movements in performance and position can be identified</li>
<li>determine the status of different enterprises to evaluate relative financial performance and position</li>
</ul>
<p>An important component of financial statements is the disclosures regarding accounting policies and accounting estimates. Accounting policies determine the way to deal with related transactions. They enable users to ascertain the way in which expenditure or income or assets or liabilities are treated. They therefore enable users to understand previous financial performances and extrapolate these into the future.</p>
<p>A disclosure regarding changes in accounting policies is another important tool which enables comparability of financial statements.</p>
