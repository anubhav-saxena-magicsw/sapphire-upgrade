<p>The reporting date is an extremely important one for accountants because financial statements and reports are prepared up to / as on that date. However, what happens if some important event (e.g. a major customer filing for bankruptcy) occurs after the reporting date but before the statement of financial position is authorised? This study discusses the accounting for events after the reporting date.</p>
<p>Financial statements are prepared assuming the going concern principle. This Study Guide discusses the treatment to be given if there are going concern issues arising after the reporting period. For example, Pure Steels imports its major raw material from only one supplier. This supplier has been taken over by the main competitor of Pure Steels after the reporting period. What does one do in cases like these?</p>
