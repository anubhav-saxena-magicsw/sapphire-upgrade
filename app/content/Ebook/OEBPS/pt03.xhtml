<p>An important component of any statement of financial position is non-current assets. If this figure is incorrectly stated, it can affect a number of areas. For example, companies are often given loans which are secured on the basis of the non-current assets they have. This means that if the loans are not repaid, the bank has the right to take the non-current assets in return, to sell and obtain the cash to settle the loans. So, if the non-current asset value is incorrectly calculated, the company may not be able to pay off its loans.</p>
<p>As an accountant, you will be expected to understand the value at which non-current assets should be held in the statement of financial position and to make all the necessary adjustments to account for depreciation, revaluations and disposals. This in turn will enable you to make decisions such as how much money your company can borrow; whether there are any problems with your non-current assets and whether your capitalisation policy makes sense.</p>
