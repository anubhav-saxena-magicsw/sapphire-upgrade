<p>As with any profession, people who practice accountancy are expected to possess certain expertise. Under this assumption, society accepts advice from professional accountants in good faith and acts on this advice.</p>
<p>The main area, in which this faith is evident, is the reliance on financial statements prepared by professional accountants. Readers should be able to accept them without question and in turn base their decisions on them.</p>
<p>There has to be some mechanism to ensure that accounting work is performed according to set principles and standards. Furthermore, an assurance is needed that the assumed professional expertise does actually exist and is applied to the work in hand. This is achieved by means of a regulatory framework.</p>
<p>As an accountant, you can not underestimate the importance of the regulatory framework. Without it, you will not be able to do your job properly. In future, you will need to remain up-to-date on this area; otherwise you will have no idea about any changes that occur in the accountancy profession!</p>
