<p>In today&#x2019;s global economy, group and associated companies normally carry out transactions among each other. These transactions can have an important effect on the statement of profit or loss and the financial position of the businesses concerned. The definition of related parties includes the members of a group company; therefore, transactions between related parties are a common characteristic of business.</p>
<p>For example, Rogers Limited may sell engines to Dina Limited, which is a member of the Roger Limited Group, at a lower rate compared to the rate at which it sells the same type of engine to Bila Limited, which is not a part of the Rogers Limited Group. Transactions with a group company will therefore affect the statement of profit or loss and the financial position of the group company, as Rogers will be showing sales at below fair value and Dina will be showing purchases at below fair value in their individual financial statements. Therefore the IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures requires that a disclosure of such transactions needs to be made in the financial statements of the company. This will enable the readers of the financial statements to understand what is actually happening in each of the companies.</p>
<p>Transactions, which take place between related parties, are known as related party transactions. A variety of stakeholders have different interests in an entity. There is a risk that some of these relationships will lead to a conflict of interests. Examples include transaction with entities under common control or transactions between an entity and its directors. In order to aid transparency IAS 24 &#x2019;Related Parties&#x2019; requires disclosure of such transactions between related parties to be disclosed in the financial statements.</p>
<p>In this Study Guide we will examine the concept of related parties and the disclosures in the financial statements in this connection, which are required according to IAS 24.</p>
