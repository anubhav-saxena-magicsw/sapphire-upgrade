         </p><p id="job-1-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
         </p><p id="job-1-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the east.
         </p><p id="job-1-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.
         </p><p id="job-1-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.
         </p><p id="job-1-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
         </p><p id="job-1-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
         </p><p id="job-1-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?
         </p><p id="job-1-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?
         </p><p id="job-1-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.
         </p><p id="job-1-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face.
         </p><p id="job-1-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.
         </p><p id="job-1-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
         </p><p id="job-1-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:
         </p><p id="job-1-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
         </p><p id="job-1-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
         </p><p id="job-1-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
         </p><p id="job-1-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:
         </p><p id="job-1-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
         </p><p id="job-1-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,
         </p><p id="job-1-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
         </p><p id="job-1-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
         </p><h2 id="job-2">Chapter 2</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-2-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.
         </p><p id="job-2-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.
         </p><p id="job-2-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.
         </p><p id="job-2-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.
         </p><p id="job-2-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.
         </p><p id="job-2-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but save his life.
         </p><p id="job-2-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
         </p><p id="job-2-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he sat down among the ashes.
         </p><p id="job-2-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  curse God, and die.
         </p><p id="job-2-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
         </p><p id="job-2-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.
         </p><p id="job-2-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
         </p><p id="job-2-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.
         </p><h2 id="job-3">Chapter 3</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-3-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
         </p><p id="job-3-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> And Job spake, and said,
         </p><p id="job-3-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
         </p><p id="job-3-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
         </p><p id="job-3-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
         </p><p id="job-3-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
         </p><p id="job-3-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
         </p><p id="job-3-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
         </p><p id="job-3-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
         </p><p id="job-3-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
         </p><p id="job-3-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
         </p><p id="job-3-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
         </p><p id="job-3-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
         </p><p id="job-3-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate places for themselves;
         </p><p id="job-3-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
         </p><p id="job-3-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
         </p><p id="job-3-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
         </p><p id="job-3-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
         </p><p id="job-3-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
         </p><p id="job-3-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
         </p><p id="job-3-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
         </p><p id="job-3-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
         </p><p id="job-3-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
         </p><p id="job-3-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
         </p><p id="job-3-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
         </p><p id="job-3-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
         </p><h2 id="job-4">Chapter 4</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-4-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
         </p><p id="job-4-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
         </p><p id="job-4-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
         </p><p id="job-4-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
         </p><p id="job-4-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
         </p><p id="job-4-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
         </p><p id="job-4-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
         </p><p id="job-4-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
         </p><p id="job-4-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
         </p><p id="job-4-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
         </p><p id="job-4-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
         </p><p id="job-4-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
         </p><p id="job-4-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
         </p><p id="job-4-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
         </p><p id="job-4-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
         </p><p id="job-4-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
         </p><p id="job-4-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
         </p><p id="job-4-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
         </p><p id="job-4-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
         </p><p id="job-4-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
         </p><p id="job-4-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
         </p><h2 id="job-5">Chapter 5</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-5-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
         </p><p id="job-5-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
         </p><p id="job-5-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
         </p><p id="job-5-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
         </p><p id="job-5-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
         </p><p id="job-5-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
         </p><p id="job-5-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
         </p><p id="job-5-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
         </p><p id="job-5-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
         </p><p id="job-5-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
         </p><p id="job-5-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
         </p><p id="job-5-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
         </p><p id="job-5-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
         </p><p id="job-5-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
         </p><p id="job-5-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
         </p><p id="job-5-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
         </p><p id="job-5-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
         </p><p id="job-5-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
         </p><p id="job-5-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
         </p><p id="job-5-20"><span class="num-verse-rw">20</span> In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
         </p><p id="job-5-21"><span class="num-verse-rw">21</span> Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
         </p><p id="job-5-22"><span class="num-verse-rw">22</span> At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
         </p><p id="job-5-23"><span class="num-verse-rw">23</span> For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
         </p><p id="job-5-24"><span class="num-verse-rw">24</span> And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
         </p><p id="job-5-25"><span class="num-verse-rw">25</span> Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
         </p><p id="job-5-26"><span class="num-verse-rw">26</span> Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
         </p><p id="job-5-27"><span class="num-verse-rw">27</span> Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
         </p><h2 id="job-6">Chapter 6</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-6-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> But Job answered and said,
         </p><p id="job-6-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
         </p><p id="job-6-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
         </p><p id="job-6-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
         </p><p id="job-6-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
         </p><p id="job-6-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
         </p><p id="job-6-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
         </p><p id="job-6-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
         </p><p id="job-6-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
         </p><p id="job-6-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
         </p><p id="job-6-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
         </p><p id="job-6-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
         </p><p id="job-6-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
         </p><p id="job-6-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
         </p><p id="job-6-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
         </p><p id="job-6-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
         </p><p id="job-6-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
         </p><p id="job-6-18"><span class="num-verse-rw">18</span> The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
         </p><p id="job-6-19"><span class="num-verse-rw">19</span> The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.

         </p><p id="job-41-29"><span class="num-verse-rw">29</span> Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.

         </p><h2 id="job-42">Chapter 42</h2><p class="firstpara-rw" id="job-42-1"><span class="num-verse-rw">1</span> Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
         </p><p id="job-42-2"><span class="num-verse-rw">2</span> I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
         </p><p id="job-42-3"><span class="num-verse-rw">3</span> Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.
         </p><p id="job-42-4"><span class="num-verse-rw">4</span> Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
         </p><p id="job-42-5"><span class="num-verse-rw">5</span> I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eye seeth thee.
         </p><p id="job-42-6"><span class="num-verse-rw">6</span> Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
         </p><p id="job-42-7"><span class="num-verse-rw">7</span> And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
         </p><p id="job-42-8"><span class="num-verse-rw">8</span> Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my servant Job.
         </p><p id="job-42-9"><span class="num-verse-rw">9</span> So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: the LORD also accepted Job.
         </p><p id="job-42-10"><span class="num-verse-rw">10</span> And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
         </p><p id="job-42-11"><span class="num-verse-rw">11</span> Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
         </p><p id="job-42-12"><span class="num-verse-rw">12</span> So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
         </p><p id="job-42-13"><span class="num-verse-rw">13</span> He had also seven sons and three daughters.
         </p><p id="job-42-14"><span class="num-verse-rw">14</span> And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
         </p><p id="job-42-15"><span class="num-verse-rw">15</span> And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
         </p><p id="job-42-16"><span class="num-verse-rw">16</span> After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
         </p><p id="job-42-17"><span class="num-verse-rw">17</span> So Job died, being old and full of days.
