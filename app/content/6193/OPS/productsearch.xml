Newton’s 3rd Law also explains the transfer of momentum from one object to another during impact situations in sport. The object with the largest momentum (mass x velocity) will transfer some of their force onto the other object. Experiment: Newton’s 3rd Law Aim: Investigate the effect of ground reaction forces on three types of sprint start.  Standing start - body upright, one foot in front of the other, knees slightly bent  Crouching (3 point) start - back at 45°, knees bent, one hand forward on ground  Block start – both feet positioned against running blocks with fingers forward on the ground Hypothesis (what you think the results of your experiment will be?) Equipment: 1 set of starting blocks, 2 stop watches, measuring tape and flat outdoor area Method: In groups of three perform the following: a. Measure out a fifteen metre strip on a piece of flat ground. b. One person performs a series of three, 15 metre sprints for each of the start positions (standing crouched and block). A block start can be performed with the back heel against a wall if blocks are not available. c. Two people measure time taken for each sprint averaging their results (to eliminate error). d.

Levers are used to produce force and velocity of movement more efficiently and are divided into 1st, 2nd and 3rd class levers according to the way the axis, force arm and resistance arm are configured. The human body is made up of mainly third class levers with the force arm length being shorter than the resistance arm length and both being on the same side of the lever axis.

When two objects collide momentum can be transferred from one object to another as occurs when a club head swings around to transfer momentum to a golf ball, propelling it away from the tee. The conservation of momentum principle states that the total amount of momentum between two objects involved in a collision will be the same both before and after impact. Experiment: Transfer of Linear Momentum Design an experiment investigating the effect of a follow-through when maximising transfer of linear momentum during a sporting movement (such as a cricket stroke). Before: Net Linear Momentum of the ball carrier and tackler before the collision is 10 kg m/sec west. Linear Momentum of Ball Carrier p = 240 kg m/sec Mass Velocity × After: Ball carrier and tackler move together as a single unit in the tackle with a combined momentum of 10 kg m/sec west. Combined Linear Momentum of Tackler and Ball Carrier p = 10 kg m/sec (Mass × Velocity) + (Mass × Velocity) N S E W Example: Conservation of Linear Momentum (p) in a rugby tackle.

Example: Using linear motion to improve backhand accuracy Activity: Using Linear Momentum to Improve Skill Technique a. Choose a physical activity which requires accuracy and has movements that use linear motion b. Break the movement down into its preparation, action and follow through phases.

In a baseball, the pitcher can cause the ball to swerve depending on the side-spin put on the ball. The ball has a tendency to move from high to low pressure. As the ball spins differences in pressure are created by the rotation of the ball against the oncoming air flow. This phenomenon is known as the Magnus Effect. Example: Racket head rolls across the top of tennis ball to apply top spin Activity: Applying spin forces in Tennis 1. Draw a diagram of the spin forces that occur as under-spin is applied to the ball in tennis. 2a. Compare and contrast the Magnus effect on tennis balls struck with different types of spin. In groups of five, one person should perform each of the following roles:  A player (preferably someone who has some tennis experience) will hit a forehand ground-stroke from the baseline across the net using top-spin, flat and under-spin stroke.  Three other people will each observe flight trajectory, ball speed and shot distance as well as rebound height and distance. A video camera may be used to increase accuracy comparing each stroke.  One person performs the role of experimenter ensuring the ball is struck with the same amount of speed, height and angle of release to allow accurate comparison of all types of stroke. To ensure angle and height of release is consistent the ball could be hit through a hula-hoop held at shoulder height one meter in front of the impact point.

Angular motion is produced when forces are applied away from the axis of rotation of a body. One of the most common forms of angular motion occurs when body segments rotate about a joint axis. Angular motion of body segments can be accelerated by shortening (flexing) body segments. Just before the point of impact the moment arm can be lengthened to apply greater amounts of linear velocity to an object. Activity: Angular Motion 1.

Moment of inertia is the distribution of an objects mass around its axis of rotation. The conservation of Angular Momentum states that moment of inertia and angular velocity are inversely proportional to each other, as one increases the other will decrease if angular momentum is constant. Example: Conservation of Angular Momentum in a Pike Dive Momentum is conserved by an increase in Angular Velocity as a diver decreases their Moment of Inertia Practical Activity: Conservation of Angular Momentum Background Information: When an athlete is off the ground angular momentum is constant as it is unable to be affected by an external force.

Explain using principles of physics the reason for this. Balance and Stability Balance can be defined as a body’s state of equilibrium (symmetry). Balance has a direct impact on a person’s ability to perform movements with precision andcontrol. Stability is an objects resistance to being moved and is affected by mass, base of support and line of gravity. Increasing Balance and Stability Achieving increased balance and stability involves controlling centre of gravity, line of gravity and base of support. Being in a stable position allows people to:  apply large forces since all generated force can be effectively transferred.  accurately complete movements through increased body control. Centre of gravity can be roughly calculated by drawing a box around a person’s outer extremities and bisecting diagonal lines. Centre of Gravity Point at which all parts of the body are equally balanced. Base of Support Area within the body’s contact with the ground. Line of Gravity Line that passes vertically through the centre of gravity. Stable Required for static balance activities such as clay shooting.
