Through thorough study, observation, and technology, we have learned that Earth and other planets; their more than 170 moons; a number of dwarf planets; and a multitude of other small bodies such as comets, asteroids, and meteors, orbit the Sun. We now know that the Sun’s influence stretches out about 100 times farther than the distance from the Sun to Earth. Beyond the limit of the Sun’s influence, lies the emptiness of interstellar space, which separates our Solar System from those of other stars in our galaxy.VIDEO 1 This extreme ultraviolet light video taken by NASA’sSolar Dynamics Observatory captured a solar eruption as itoccurred on December 31, 2012.

Watch the animation below of several months of a typical night sky, as viewed from the same location on Earth. Identify any patterns you see.ANIMATION 1 Select the ‘Play’ button to watch the night sky.What did you notice? Was everything orderly or did some objects seem more orderly than others? Repeat the animation until you are satisfied you&apos;ve seen all the patterns present. Then answer the questions that follow.6Solar System: Earth in Space 1.1.2</bodyText><bookMarkId>3</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>3</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page004</spineIdRef><pageRef>page004.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>1.2.3 Measuring Positions of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun11Although Aristotle and his followers believed that Earth was at the center of the Universe, an astronomer named Aristarchus (310 BC - 230 BC) planted a seed of doubt in the prevailing hypothesis. To do this he challenged the view that the Moon and the Sun were the same size and the same distance from Earth. Although much of Aristarchus&apos; work is lost, we know he was a careful observer of the sky and probably started with the following logic to deduce that the Sun had to be much farther away than previously thought.Aristarchus might have offered that when an observer sees half of the Moon lit by the Sun (in terms of the four Moon phases, these times are called first quarter and third quarter Moon phases) during the daytime, the angle between Earth-Moon-Sun is 90°. When this event occurs, the Sun and Moon appear to the observer to be about the same size. His calculations would have shown that this equality in size is only an illusion.Solar System: Earth in Space 1.2.3FIGURE 9 First and third quarter Moons.</bodyText><bookMarkId>4</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>4</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page005</spineIdRef><pageRef>page005.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>Aristarchus&apos; work on determining the relationship between the size and position of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun was important and most likely lead to his belief that we live in a heliocentric Universe. After all, how could a body with such superior mass (the Sun) revolve around a body with significantly less mass (Earth) each day?Despite observational evidence, Aristarchus&apos; ideas that Earth was in motion and orbited the Sun were mostly ignored. One contemporary, Archimedes, and much later Copernicus, gave credit to Aristarchus for his belief in a heliocentric Universe. (Today, of course, we use the term Universe differently. In his time, Aristarchus meant the planets in our Solar System and the constellations of stars in our galaxy seen to the naked eye. Today, when we say Universe, we mean the vast space which contains all of the matter and energy in existence.)It took a great deal more observation and better tools to build on Aristarchus’ findings and convince others about the relationship between distance and apparent size. Further inquiry began to explain Earth’s place in space, as well as the location of other objects in the Solar System.FIGURE 12 Statue of Copernicus.15Solar System: Earth in Space 1.2.4 FIGURE 12 Statue of Copernicus.</bodyText><bookMarkId>5</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>5</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page006</spineIdRef><pageRef>page006.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>21Solar System: Earth in Space 1.3.2</bodyText><bookMarkId>6</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>6</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page007</spineIdRef><pageRef>page007.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>Flyby: Robotic spacecraft began detailed observation of Mars in the 1960s. On November 28, 1964, Mariner 4 launched. 228 days later it became the first spacecraft ever to fly by the red planet. This image, taken from Mariner 4, is the first photograph clearly showing craters on Mars. Because it passed Mars quickly, it took only a handful of images. Image courtesy: NASA.SLIDE SHOW 3 Spacecraft observations of planets.Exploration happens in key phases, as technologies get better and better. First, we send spacecraft to fly by the planets, collecting what data they can as they pass. Next, we send orbiters, which can spend more time at a planet or moon, providing detailed and close-up views. Landers and probes allow close-up investigations of a given place. Rovers (and even balloons, airplanes, and other mobile robots of the future) allow long-term investigations over the terrain of rocky planets and moons. Samples of everything, from interstellar dust to comet materials to rocks and soils of rocky planets and moons, allow us to study materials brought back in Earth laboratories. Robotic missions also pave the way for human exploration beyond Earth orbit, particularly to the Moon and Mars. Through various imaging and planetary missions, we continue to extend our knowledge of the Solar System. For an example of this progress, view the following slide show on Mars.ANIMATION 5 Travel through the deep valley of VallesMarineris on Mars. Image courtesy: NASA/JPL/ArizonaState University.
