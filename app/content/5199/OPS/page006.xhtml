			<div id="pop-over4" class="pop-over4 pop_over" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="auto" data-content="Ptolemy's geocentric model of the Solar System explained the paths of the five known planets, as well as the paths of the Sun and the Moon. It included epicycles, the secondary circular orbit of planets, that seemed to explain retrograde motion. The Ptolemaic model was the accepted theory for well over a thousand years."></div>

			<div id="pop-over6" class="pop-over6 pop_over" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="auto" data-content="Tycho Brahe is thought to be one of the best astronomers of all time. His observations of the planets, even though made with the unaided eye, were extremely accurate. Part of his claim to fame was his hiring of Johannes Kepler who used Brahe’s data to argue for a heliocentric Solar System, which Brahe himself did not believe in."></div>
			<div id="pop-over7" class="pop-over7 pop_over" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="auto" data-content="Galileo Galilei, recognizing the power of the just invented telescope, built his own and through observations discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter and the phases of Venus. This data provided crucial evidence in support for the Copernican heliocentric model of the Solar System. His works were banned by the Roman Church and he was imprisoned for his radical beliefs. He remained under house arrest until he died."></div>
			<div id="pop-over8" class="pop-over8 pop_over" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="left" data-content="Johannes Kepler was Galileo’s contemporary and Brahe’s successor. Kepler used Brahe’s observations to establish his Three Laws of Planetary Motion. These laws did away with circular orbits, settling instead on elliptical orbits, and explained that the speed of a planet’s orbits is determined by its distance from the Sun. Keeping a low profile, he avoided Galileo’s fate, even though his work supported the concept of a heliocentric Solar System."></div>
			<div id="pop-over9" class="pop-over9 pop_over" data-toggle="popover" data-placement="left" data-content="Isaac Newton's contribution to our understanding of the Solar System was grounded in his ability to explain (through his Laws of Motion) the reason objects in the Solar System behave as others observed. This was crucial in terms of supporting the observations of Galileo and Kepler. Newton explained the physics behind their observations, solidifying the heliocentric model first alluded to by Aristarchus, and built upon by Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler."></div>
