Their neighbour, too, had a son—Muthu. He was thoroughly spoilt; his parents doted1 on him and let him do exactly as he pleased. So every day, Muthu did the craziest of things and his parents made no effort to stop him.The boy’s favourite pastime was throwing stones at the customers who came to Subbu’s shop. His parents merely looked on and did nothing. If the customers or Subbu shouted at the boy, he just chuckled2 and threw more stones. Soon people stopped going to Subbu’s shop, because although they liked doing business with him, they didn’t like being pelted with stones every time they went to his shop.1doted: were very fond of2chuckled: laughed quietly</bodyText><bookMarkId>35</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>3</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page036</spineIdRef><pageRef>page036.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>36Poor Subbu was very unhappy. He went to his neighbour and said, ‘Please ask your son not to throw stones at my customers.’But the parents paid no attention.Subbu then complained to the headman of the village, but the headman only said, ‘This is the act of a mad boy and he cannot be held responsible for it. You must forgive him and carry on with your business as best you can.’ There was nothing Subbu could do, so he went home very disheartened.Subbu’s son, Somu, who had heard the headman’s verdict3, was very upset to see his father so unhappy and decided to do something about it.The next morning when his father opened the shop, Somu stood outside, facing the neighbour’s house. Whenever Muthu hurled a stone, he caught it and kept it. He did not miss a single one. In the evening, when all the customers had left and his father closed the shop for the day, the boy gathered all the stones and took them home.Day after day Somu caught the stones, making sure the customers were not hurt. And every evening he took the stones home.One day, Muthu came out of his house, grinning from ear to ear. He threw a packet at Subbu’s shop and disappeared into his house.Somu caught the packet and opened it. To his surprise, he found it was full of jewellery, not stones. Gold earrings, necklaces and nose-studs glittered4 in the bright sunlight.Somu took the packet home and hid it in a bag of rice. Then he came out again and took his position outside his father’s shop.Just then Muthu’s parents rushed towards him. ‘Return the packet my son just threw,’ said Muthu’s mother. 3verdict: a decision given in a law case after testing4glittered: shone brightly with little ﬂ ashes of light</bodyText><bookMarkId>36</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>4</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page037</spineIdRef><pageRef>page037.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>37‘What packet?’ asked Somu with an innocent look. ‘I only catch the stones your son throws. In fact, I have hundreds of them. Perhaps you would like to take some of those back.’‘My son threw my jewels out,’ screamed the mother. ‘Return them or I’ll go to the headman.’‘Please go to the headman,’ said the clever boy. ‘In fact, I will accompany you.’The headman listened to Muthu’s parents. He also listened to Somu. He understood exactly what the boy had done.There was a hush5 in the village square as the villagers waited to hear the headman’s verdict. The headman was about to speak when Somu spoke up. ‘The headman is a very fair judge. He cannot give us a different verdict this time. What he said earlier still holds true —that this is the act of a mad boy and must be ignored. And Muthu must be forgiven.’The village headman had no option but to agree.‘Subbu’s son did not throw any of the stones back at your son, and you did not complain about that,’ he told Muthu’s parents, who looked shamefaced. ‘So if your son threw a packet, then the packet and its contents should be his too. And in future, curb6 your son’s actions. You didn’t object to his throwing stones, how can you object to his throwing other objects?’ After that, Subbu was no longer bothered by Muthu and customers once more ﬂ ocked7 to his shop.5hush: silence6curb: check7ﬂ ocked: came in large numbers</bodyText><bookMarkId>37</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>5</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page038</spineIdRef><pageRef>page038.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>38RWLearn to read—11.
