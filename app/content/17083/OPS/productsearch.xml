First, it is student-centered, with the goal of helping all students to understand and enjoy science. Second, it is authentic to the way scientists work, and it asks you to begin to think and investigate as a scientist does. Finally, it is organized around important global issues related to sustainability.Students and their teachers around the United States tested this course and gave feedback, which we used to revise and improve the program. From this testing we learned what high school students ﬁnd interesting, what is easier or more difﬁcult for you to learn, and how to provide learning experiences to help you progress in your understanding of science. During this course you will participate in a wide range of activities, including hands-on labs, hands-on models, interactive com-puter simulations of scientiﬁc concepts, readings describing how scientiﬁc theo-ries are developed and are applied today, and discussions and debates. You will also connect what you learn to your own life, your community, and the world.In this course, you will engage in a process of inquiry similar to that which scien-tists use. Scientiﬁc inquiry involves asking questions about the natural world, gathering evidence, and constructing logical explanations to answer those ques-tions. The activities in this course will help you become more conﬁdent, compe-tent, and independent in designing, analyzing, and communicating scientiﬁc investigations. They will also show you how scientists develop new hypotheses and theories, and help you develop your own explanations of important ﬁndings in science. Like all SEPUP courses, this one teaches science in the context of important issues of our times. In this course all issues relate to the theme of sustainability. Sustain-ability refers to the ability of a community to meet its present needs without com-promising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.Each of the scientiﬁc topics in this course relates to sustainable development—that is, humans’ use of environmental resources in a responsible way to ensure that they will continue to be available for future generations. Issues of science and sustainability directly affect your personal life, your community, and the world as a whole. By considering some of these important issues in this course, you will gain the skills necessary for making decisions critical to your future and the future of other living things on earth.

You will evaluate scientiﬁc evidence to determine which proposed solutions are most likely to be effective. In some cases you will develop your own solutions.We hope that this course will show you that learning more about science is valu-able, enjoyable, and relevant to your life and the future of the world.The SEPUP Science and Global Issues Staff</bodyText><bookMarkId>23</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>23</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0024</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0024.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>xxiii SEPUP DEVELOPS BOTH comprehensive and supplemental science programs for middle school and high school learners. All SEPUP programs are issue- oriented, and provide learning resources that promote scientiﬁc literacy and the importance of evidence in decision making. Science and Global Issues includes the following features common to SEPUP materials.Science and Global Issues is research-based.Units and activities are based on research on how students learn science, including the speciﬁc concepts in this course. The course is designed and tested through sev-eral rounds of classroom ﬁeld testing, and revised based on the evidence we gather from students and their teachers. At each phase, several scientists working in ﬁelds related to each unit provide insight on current work by scientists and review the written materials.Science and Global Issues is student-centered.Because the ideas and knowledge you already have are important starting points for your learning, activities in SGI begin with what you know and think about science concepts and sustainability issues. As you conduct the activities, you will expand your understanding, and sometimes you may ﬁnd that your ideas are changing. You will have many chances to connect what you are doing in science class to your own life and to the world around you.Science and Global Issues emphasizes inquiry.In many SGI activities you will follow an inquiry approach to learning. Inquiry is a process of asking and answering questions. In this approach, you will analyze data collected by you and by others, investigate the evidence that supports scientiﬁc ideas, develop and evaluate explanations, and communicate explanations verbally and in writing. This process of asking questions and searching for logical, evidence-based answers is similar to the processes of inquiry that scientists employ.Science and Global Issues is an issue-oriented approach to science.Each SGI unit focuses on a major issue related to sustainability. You will build knowledge and understanding of the science concepts most important for under-standing the issue. Throughout each unit you will also learn more about the issue About SEPUP and Science and Global Issues</bodyText><bookMarkId>24</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>24</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0025</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0025.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGYxxivand about the perspectives of various people affected by it. In the ﬁnal activity of each unit, you will apply what you learned to make personal or group decisions about the most sustainable course of action. Science and Global Issues includes an embedded research-based assessment system. Research has shown that SEPUP’s assessment system helps students learn science, conduct scientiﬁc investigations, and apply scientiﬁc knowledge to recommend evidence-based choices about issues. The assessments in SGI assess your work in the following ﬁve key areas:• Understanding of science concepts• Ability to design and analyze investigations• Ability to use evidence and the concept of trade-offs to recommend decisions related to sustainability issues• Ability to communicate ideas clearly• Contributions to group activitiesScience and Global Issues provides embedded literacy support. These tested strategies help you to learn how to better read science texts, write clear descriptions of your laboratory results and conclusions, and explain scien-tiﬁc ideas. The strategies also help you to express and discuss your ideas verbally, and engage in scientiﬁc argument—a process by which scientists evaluate scien-tiﬁc claims and hypotheses.</bodyText><bookMarkId>25</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>25</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0026</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0026.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>xxvABOUT SEPUP AND SCIENCE AND GLOBAL ISSUESHow Science and Global Issues is organized:SGI UNITSCIENCE CONTENT ISSUE FOCUSSustainabilitySustainabilityIndicatorsLife cycle of productsCorrelation and causalityAspects of sustainability from a personal, community, and global perspectiveEcology: Living on EarthBiomesStability and change in ecosystemsInvasive speciesPopulation dynamicsEnergy ﬂow through ecosystemsCarbon and nitrogen cyclesPhotosynthesis and cellular respirationSymbiotic relationshipsPredator–prey relationshipsSustainability from an ecosys-tems perspective, with a focus on humans’ impacts on ecosystems Making decisions regarding ﬁsh-eries managementCell Biology: World HealthCellular nature of lifeCell structure and functionCell specialization and differentiationCell division and the cell cycleMicrobes and infectious diseasesBreakdown of cellular function in diseases, such as diabetes and cancerRespiration, photosynthesis, and cellular macromolecules Disparities between developing and developed countries in terms of diseases’ impacts on lifeMaking decisions about priorities for disease interventions to pre-vent or treat diseases that limit social, economic, and environ-mental progressGenetics: Feeding the World Sexual and asexual reproductionMitosis and meiosisGenotype and phenotypeMendel’s researchGenetic crosses, Punnett squares, and pedigreesPatterns of inheritanceGenes, alleles, chromosomes, and DNAFlow of genetic informationSelective breedingGenetically modiﬁed organismsComparison of selective breeding and genetic modiﬁcationUse of genetically modiﬁed organisms, particularly in the pro-duction of agricultural cropsEvolution: Maintaining DiversityBiodiversityEcosystem services and humans’ impact on speciesNatural selection and adaptationDarwin’s researchGeologic timeInterpreting the fossil recordPhylogenyMicroevolution and macroevolutionBiological species concept and speciationThe genetic basis of evolutionConserving genetic, species, and ecosystem diversityEcosystems services and intrinsic value models for conservation</bodyText><bookMarkId>26</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>26</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0027</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0027.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>xxviThe introduction presents information you will need for the activity. It often includes vocabulary words that will help you under-stand what you are learning and help you participate in scientific discussions. Make sure you read it thoroughly before you begin the activity. THIS IS AN innovative science program. During this biology course you com-plete a series of activities, many of them with a partner or in a group of four students. To learn the material in this course, read and conduct each activity carefully. It takes more than simply reading the book to understand the ideas being presented. Partici-pate fully in the labora-tory, investigation, simulation, and discus-sion activities to get the whole picture! How to Use Science and Global Issues or coral reefs near the shore of the ocean it is easy for us to see the various parts of an ecosystem, especially because the near-shore ecosystems tend to be particularly productive and have a high level of biodiversity. The level of biodiversity in an ecosystem, however, is not always obvious. For example, con-sider the open ocean: huge and deep bodies of waters away from coasts and conti-nental shelves. The open ocean is an ecosystem that supports populations of ﬁsh, whales, and other animals. Think about a tuna or a whale in the middle of the ocean, far from any land, reef, or kelp forest. What does it eat? Where does its oxygen come from? Much of the life in the open ocean consists of free-ﬂoating organisms called plankton. Plankton are drifting organisms that live for at least part of their life in the open ocean or other body of water. The majority of plankton are minuscule; in fact, one drop of ocean water can contain thousands of plankton. Most plankton inhabit the top 20 m (about 66 feet) of the water. Those are concentrated in this narrow layer of the ocean because that is as deep as sunlight penetrates water fairly easily. This light allows plankton that are capable of photosynthesis—phytoplank-ton—to survive. Phytoplankton are responsible for nearly half of the oxygen pro-duction on Earth! Other plankton, called zooplankton, are consumers that feed on phytoplankton or other zooplankton. Plankton are the sole food source for most larval ﬁsh and many open-ocean consumers. The blue whale is the largest living organism in the world. It’s a consumer, and its diet consists entirely of plankton, which it strains from the water with the baleen plates in its mouth. You and your partner will observe eight prepared slides of plankton. Choose one slide, and place it on your microscope stage. Hint: Most of the plankton you will see are multicellular creatures similar to the ones shown in the image at the end of Part B. You might also see some single-celled plankton on your slide. Use the information on the next page, “Focusing a Microscope,” as guidelines for how to use your microscope. Begin by observing the specimen at the lowest level of magniﬁcation, and draw what you see. Observe the specimen at each of the higher levels of magniﬁcation, and draw what you see at each level. Note: Use only the ﬁne-focus knob for a middle- or high-magniﬁcation setting to avoid breaking the slide. In your science notebook, sketch what you observe on the slides, as directed by your teacher. Label your sketch with the name of the plankton on the slide. Make notes on any features you see that help you to decide whether it is a phytoplankton or a zooplankton.

If your teacher directs you to, add one drop of methyl cellulose to the drop on the slide. Carefully touch one edge of the coverslip to the water, at an angle. Slowly allow the coverslip to fall into place. This should prevent trapping of air bubbles under the coverslip. Center the slide so that the well is directly over the light opening, and adjust the microscope settings as necessary. Begin by observing the sample on the lowest objective lens. You may need to search the slide to ﬁnd specimens, and they may move across your ﬁeld of view. Draw at least two different organisms that you observe. For each drawing be sure to record the level of magniﬁcation. Refer to the drawings on the next page to help you identify the organisms in your drawings. Boxes like this one provide detailed instructions for using equipment or execut-ing techniques for the Procedure steps. Other boxes provide case studies that connect the science in the activity to current issues and real-world situations.Photographs, diagrams, and their captions provide relevant information and examples to help you understand the text and investigations. The plankton you have been examining are only a few examples of the thousands of species of plankton found in the oceans and freshwater bodies around the world. The Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) ﬁshery is one of the largest com-mercial ﬁsheries on the east coast of the United States. A ﬁshery is an industry that catches or raises a speciﬁc type of ﬁsh or shellﬁsh to be processed or sold. To better understand the link between plankton and this ﬁshery, complete the calculations below in your science notebook. It is estimated that the mature Atlantic herring population today has a bio-mass (total weight of the population) of approximately 2 million metric tonnes (2 billion kg). If an average adult Atlantic herring weighs 0.125 kg, how many adult Atlantic herring are there in the entire population?Hint: An adult Atlantic herring consumes, on average, 10 g of plankton per day. How much plankton would the adult Atlantic herring population consume in a day? In some places, human impacts on the marine environment, such as coastal erosion, global warming, and pollution, have caused up to a 70% decrease in the biomass of plankton. If there were a severe reduction of plankton avail-able to the Atlantic herring population, and therefore a 55% decrease in the herring, how many mature Atlantic herring would be supported by the eco-system? How many kilograms? Some Procedure sections present further detail or necessary terms to help you through the activity.When a Procedure step is written as a question, be sure to write your answers and data in your science notebook. Identify at least two similarities and two differences between phytoplankton and zooplankton. What is the role of phytoplankton in an aquatic ecosystem? Did you observe evidence of the roles of phytoplankton or zooplankton in your sample of live plankton? Explain. How might changes in the amount of plankton in the ocean affect the ocean’s ability to provide a sustainable source of food for the world’s human popula-tion? Explain. Strict ﬁshing limits were set on the Atlantic herring ﬁshery in the 1970s and 1980s because the population had dropped to about 75,000 metric tons. There was alarm that the population was so small that it was not sustainable if unlimited ﬁshing continued. By the early 1990s the population returned to historically normal levels, and the yearly catch limit now ranges from 80,000 to 124,000 metric tons to keep the ﬁshery sustainable. If the scenario in Procedure Step 15 were to occur, would the Atlantic her-ring ﬁshery still be sustainable? Explain what indicator(s) you would use to monitor this.Hint: The biomass of the Atlantic Herring can be found in Procedure Step 13. What do you think would happen to the sustainability of the plankton population if this scenario occurred? Explain. Analysis questions follow each activity. Answering these questions allows you to check your understanding, put together what you have learned in an activity, and explain how it connects to other activities in the unit. You cannot just look up the answers—many are based on your own investigations. Make sure you show what you have learned!Bold vocabulary words are defined in this activity.

The effects of diseases vary from mild to devastating and affect sustainability at the environmental, economic, and social level. For example, foot-and-mouth and mad cow diseases have periodically wiped out huge herds of cattle, causing economic hardship for those whose liveli-hoods depend on the cattle. Inﬂuenza pandemics have killed millions of people, and recent epidemics of H1N1 and SARS viruses have threatened entire cities. Diseases are caused by infectious microbes, such as bacteria and viruses, genetic factors, and other events that cause breakdowns in the structure or function of cells. Understanding the mechanisms of a disease is essential to people’s ability to prevent, eradicate, and cure it and to maintain the sustainability of populations and communities.In this unit you will examine several diseases and their social, environmental, and economic consequences. You will learn about the mechanism of these diseases at the cellular level. You will also investigate the structures and functions of normal cells and some of the processes that occur inside these cells. At the end of the unit, you will make recommendations for how best to allocate limited funding to address world health problems.</bodyText><bookMarkId>31</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>31</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0032</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0032.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>1 World Health and Sustainability157 LIVING ORGANISMS ARE vulnerable to disease. The effects of large-scale epidemics on human societies can be devastating. In the 14th century about one-third of the population of Europe died of the Black Death—bubonic plague. From 1918 to 1919 one-ﬁfth of the world’s population caught inﬂuenza during a pandemic that quickly killed as many as 40 million people—most of them between the ages of 20 and 40. The plague and inﬂuenza are examples of communicable—or infectious—diseases. Infectious diseases are transmitted from one person to another. Noninfectious diseases (also called noncommuni-cable diseases) are not transmitted from one person to another, and are caused by such factors as the environment, genetics, and aging. Noninfectious diseases also affect people everywhere in the world. The World Health Organization esti-mated that in 2005 more than 14 million people died of infectious diseases, while 35 million people died of noninfectious diseases.Diseases affect human populations in many ways, including socially, economically, and environmentally. When people are sick or die from a disease, their suffering or death might touch a community on a social level or heighten a society’s demand that a cure be found. There are negative economic effects related to the cost of The World Health Organization is monitoring the emerging infectious diseases shown here.</bodyText><bookMarkId>32</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>32</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0033</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0033.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>158SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGYtreatment and the loss of individuals’ productivity, and a positive economic effect in terms of the numbers of people employed in the health-care industry. There is sometimes a link between the environment and disease, as is the case when polluted air or water or the presence of disease-carrying organisms makes people sick. With such social, economic, and environmental relationships disease is a major factor in the sustainability of populations and communities. Sustainability is the ability to meet a community’s present needs without compromising the ability of future genera tions to meet their own needs.In this unit, you will study life at the cellular level and see how research by cell biologists and medical professionals has advanced society’s efforts to cure and prevent diseases.

A disease is any breakdown in the structure or func-tion of an organism. Scientists who study a particular disease gather information about how that disease affects the organism. They look at all levels of the organ-ism, from molecules and cells to organs and the whole organism. Some scientists, like cell biologists, use microscopes to study the structure and function of cells in the full array of organisms, from humans to plants to insects to microbes. A microbe is a microscopic cellular organism or a virus, and some microbes cause infectious diseases. One way to detect and study many diseases is to compare blood from healthy and sick individuals under a microscope. In this activity you will examine samples of blood from healthy and diseased people.Challenge !How do observations of cells help doctors and scientists diagnose and study diseases?MATERIALSFOR EACH GROUP OF FOUR STUDENTS prepared slide, “Patient A Blood” prepared slide, “Patient B Blood”FOR EACH PAIR OF STUDENTS microscope prepared slide, “Typical Human Blood”FOR EACH STUDENT6 Student Sheet 2.1, “Disease Information”3 sticky notes</bodyText><bookMarkId>36</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>36</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0037</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0037.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY162ProcedurePart A: Using the Light Microscope 1.

Most of the deaths from malaria are in children. In the 1950s and 1960s, world health experts began an effort to wipe out malaria. Although their techni-ques reduced malaria for a while, they ultimately failed. Today, malaria still exists, and is even spreading to parts of the world where it was thought to have been wiped out or was not a high risk.SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE MECHANISMPeople once thought that malaria was caused by inhaling the fumes from stagnant water, such as that in swamps. In 1880, a French army doctor ﬁrst observed parasites inside the red blood cells of malaria patients. It has since been found that the cause of malaria in humans is one of several species of the single-celled parasitic protist Plasmodium.(Continued on next page)CASE STUDYMalaria Burden of DiseaseNUMBER OF NEW CASES PER YEARNUMBER OF DEATHS PER YEARWorldwide200–300 million450,000United States1,500–2,0000–10Plasmodium parasites in the blood (above)Locations where malaria occurs (left)</bodyText><bookMarkId>42</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>42</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0043</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0043.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY168(Continued from previous page)Shortly after the discovery of Plasmodium, scientists deter-mined that female mosquitoes, which breed in standing water, are the vectors for malaria. A vector is an organism that does not cause the disease itself, but spreads disease-causing microbes from one host to another. The symptoms of malaria can be mild to deadly and include fever, chills, fatigue, an enlarged liver, an enlarged spleen, anemia (reduced number of red blood cells), seizures, coma, and kidney failure. The following traces the steps of malaria infections: 1. A mosquito becomes infected with Plasmodium when it bites and sucks the blood of a human infected with Plasmodium. 2. When the infected mosquito bites a person it injects Plasmodium in its saliva into that person. 3. The Plasmodium travels from the point of the mosquito bite through the bloodstream to the liver and infects liver cells. The Plasmodium then begins to reproduce inside the liver cells. Sometimes Plasmodium remains in a person’s liver and causes no symptoms. Other times the liver cells burst, releasing Plasmodium. 4. The Plasmodium travels back into the bloodstream from the liver, where it invades red blood cells and then reproduces. The infec-tion is active at this point, and the person experiences symptoms. 5. The red blood cells eventually rupture, which releases the parasites back into the blood-stream where they might be picked up by another mosquito.MALARIA PREVENTION AND TREATMENTIn the 1950s and 1960s, world health ofﬁcials hoped to eradi-cate malaria worldwide with the chemical DDT (dichlorodiphe-nyltrichloroethane). DDT is a powerful insecticide that kills many insects, including mosqui-toes. From 1947 to 1951, in areas where malaria was present in the United States, DDT was applied inside millions of households and over miles of swamps, ﬁelds, and forests. Through these DDT applications, malaria protists were effectively wiped out in this country. However, less concen-trated efforts in other malaria-ridden parts of the world, and widespread spraying of DDT to kill all sorts of other insects, cre-ated Plasmodium- carrying mos-quito populations that are now resistant to DDT.Resistance develops if a few mosqui toes in a population are genetically able to withstand The female Anopheles mosquito is a vector for malaria.</bodyText><bookMarkId>43</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>43</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0044</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0044.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>169CELLS AND DISEASE • ACTIVITY 2Nets protect people from mosquito bites, thus preventing malaria.the toxic effects of DDT. When more DDT is applied, more mos-quitoes that are sensitive to DDT die. The resistant mosquitoes, however, survive and reproduce greater numbers of resistant mosquitoes until they are a sig-niﬁcant proportion of the popu-lation, making DDT ineffective. Scientists also learned that DDT harms other organisms in the environment and is a threat to wildlife, especially birds. One effect of DDT on birds is eggshell thinning, causing the shells to break too soon and the embryo inside to die. Some evidence also suggests that DDT might cause cancer or neurological problems in humans. Today, DDT is banned for agricultural use worldwide, but it still is used in some places to control Plasmodium- carrying mosqui-toes and prevent them from biting people. DDT or alternative insecticides are typically sprayed on the inner walls of homes and on protective nets that are draped over sleeping areas, discouraging mosquitoes from coming near. Studies have shown that insecticide-treated nets are an effective and low-cost tool to control mosquitoes. A large study in Tanzania, where there is a high rate of malarial transmis-sion, investigated the effect of insecticide-treated and untreated nets on infection in children aged one month to four years. The results, summarized below, show that both reduce the risk of death from malarial infec-tion, but that there is greater success with the insecticide- treated nets.Treatment of malaria infections centers on several drugs that kill the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria. Some drugs attack the parasites when they are present in the blood, while others kill them when they are in the liver. Currently, physicians prescribe combinations of drugs that act together to kill Plasmodium.CHALLENGES TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENTThere are two problems health ofﬁcials must overcome to make mosquito-net programs more successful in preventing malaria. First, nets that are manufactured and sold pretreated with insecti-cide must be retreated within (Continued on next page)Effectiveness of Mosquito NetsPREVENTION METHODPERCENT REDUCTION IN RISK OF DEATH Insecticide-treated nets27Untreated nets19</bodyText><bookMarkId>44</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>44</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0045</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0045.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY170(Continued from previous page)6 to 12 months for them to remain fully effective. Also, the nets, even though relatively low in cost, are still too expensive for some people living in countries with few economic resources. They must rely on programs that donate or reduce the price of the nets and retreatment kits. There are also major challenges emerging with the drugs that treat malaria. In some areas, two types of Plasmodium that cause malaria have become resistant to the medication available for treatment, which means it no longer kills the parasite. The resistance of Plasmodium to drugs arises in the same way that mosquitoes acquire resis-tance to DDT. Since Plasmodium is less likely to develop resistance to several drugs at once, a com-bination of drugs is often given to patients. This approach often succeeds—as long as patients take all of the required doses of the medicine. But multidrug treatment is costly, and health care workers must monitor patients to make sure they com-plete their courses of treatment. In addition, it is often difﬁcult to get all the right medicines to isolated communities.Another potential challenge is the movement of malaria to areas with temperatures that were once too cold for the mosquitoes and Plasmodium. If the climate of an area changes in a way that favors the breeding and survival of mos-quitoes and Plasmodium, the risk for malaria in that area increases. Scientists are working with models to pre-dict how climate change could affect the risk of malaria around the world. The model below shows malaria returning to parts of the United States. The effect of climate change on malaria distribution continues to be a point of discussion in the scientiﬁc community. &quot; A model prediction of the effect of climate change on malaria distribution worldwide</bodyText><bookMarkId>45</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>45</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0046</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0046.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>171 ALL LIVING THINGS are made of one or more cells.

Evidence of TB infection has been found in the skulls of Egyptian mum-mies estimated to be at least 3,000 years old. TB is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium and was common in Europe and North America in the 18th and 19th centuries. It declined in those regions as living conditions, nutrition, and treatment improved. Worldwide today, however, it is estimated that at least one-third of the human population is infected with TB bacteria. SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE MECHANISMThe physical symptoms of TB include appetite and weight loss, coughing, night sweats, fever, fatigue, and chills. TB usually infects tissue in the lungs, but can also infect other organs in the body, including the brain, kid-neys, and spine. Since TB is an extremely infectious disease that can be passed through a cough, sneeze, or even talking with an infected person, people are at higher risk of infection if they live in densely packed urban areas or may be exposed to infected indi-viduals in crowded, closed envi-ronments, such as hospitals, prisons, clinics, or airplanes.

In a latent infection, the person has a positive skin or blood test for TB, but a normal chest X-ray. The bac-teria are alive inside the body, but they are inactive. A person with a latent infection does not feel sick, has no symp-toms, and cannot transmit the TB bacteria to others. Some-times the latent form becomes active, and symptoms develop. Only 5–10% of people who are infected with TB bacteria, however, ever become sick or infectious. Antibiotic treat-ments after a person has tested positive for TB reduce the risk of latent TB becoming active, if the person takes the drugs for many months.The following traces the steps that lead to a tuberculosis infection: 1. An uninfected person inhales TB bacteria in droplets that were released into the air by an infected person, whether minutes or hours earlier. 2. The bacteria enter the lungs, and if they are not imme-diately killed by the body’s immune system, they are ingested by macro phages, a type of white blood cell. The macro phages do not destroy the bacteria. 3. Most of the time, the bacteria are held in check by the immune system. In this case, the infection is referred to as a latent infection. 4. If the infection becomes active, the TB bacteria multiply and travel to the blood. Possible reasons for a latent infection to become active include a weakened immune system, often due to HIV/AIDS infection, malnutrition, cancer, or aging. The bacteria might spread to other organs, but they can only be trans-mitted out of the body and to other people by the infected person’s exhaling them from the lungs. TUBERCULOSIS PREVENTIONS AND TREATMENTSWhile there is a vaccine avail-able to prevent TB, its effec-tiveness is limited. Worse, the vaccine has caused HIV- positive children to develop a TB infection. Health experts think that being able to accurately detect active TB infections is more beneﬁcial than vaccination to prevent infections. In 1943, a man critically sick with TB was the ﬁrst to be given an antibiotic to treat TB. Impressively, the bacteria quickly disappeared, and the man recovered. Now there are a number of antibiotics to treat TB, and they are usually prescribed in combinations of Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria</bodyText><bookMarkId>53</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>53</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0054</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0054.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>WHAT IS A CELL? • ACTIVITY 3179two to four different drugs. Two of the most commonly pre-scribed today are isoniazid and rifampin. Isoniazid interferes with a bacterium’s ability to make a compound needed in its cell walls. Rifampin prevents the bacterial cells from making proteins. CHALLENGES TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENTANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCELike Plasmodium, TB bacteria have become resistant to many antibiotics. As with malaria, people who do not have access to timely and effective medical care or who don’t complete a full course of treatment contribute to the resistance problem. In 2014, the World Health Organi-zation (WHO) was notiﬁed of more than 480,000 cases of multidrug-resistant tubercu-losis. Multidrug resistance in TB means that the bacteria are resistant speciﬁcally to the two main antibiotics, isoniazid and rifampin. Because WHO is not notiﬁed of all cases, experts think that there are many more cases. The cost of treating multi-drug-resistant TB infec-tions can be 1,000 times more expensive than treating non-resistant TB infections. HIV/AIDS AND TB CO-INFECTIONAnother reason for the high numbers of TB infections is the relationship between TB and HIV/AIDS. These two diseases are so closely tied to one another that they are often referred to as a co-infection. HIV weakens the immune system, which then allows latent TB to become active and infec-tious or makes the patient more vulnerable to TB droplets inhaled from the air. A person who is infected with HIV/AIDS is 50 times more likely to develop active TB in a given year than is an HIV-negative person. Also, the disease progresses more rapidly and deaths are higher in people infected with both HIV and TB than those who are infected only with TB. The primary cause of death in people infected with TB and HIV is the TB. Yet the vast majority of people with HIV worldwide have not been screened for TB. &quot;</bodyText><bookMarkId>54</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>54</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0055</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0055.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>180 4 What Do Cells Do? UNDERSTANDING NORMAL CELL structures and their functions helps scientists understand what goes wrong to allow diseases, including the infectious diseases caused by microbes, to progress. Although there are many differences between cells of various organisms, such as plants, animals, and microbes, there are some key similarities in all cells. One structure common to every cell is a cell membrane that separates it from the outside environment. Similarly, every cell has genetic material in the form of DNA, and a large number of proteins and other molecules that carry out the chemical reactions needed for a cell to live, grow, and reproduce. Some cells con-tain structures that are surrounded by a membrane, which creates a barrier between the inside of the structure and the rest of the cell. These membrane-bound structures are called organelles.In this activity, you will learn about some common cell structures and their func-tions in the cell.

Read the following information about bacterial cells. This will prepare you to compare the cells of bacteria with those of animals and plants, which you investigated in Part A. ReadingBacterial Cell StructureA bacterial cell does not have a nucleus or other membrane-bound structures. The genetic information of bacterial cells is stored in a large circular chromosome in the cytoplasm. The cell membrane of a bacterial cell performs the functions of many of the organelles of other organisms’ cells. For example, to generate energy, a bacterial cell uses speciﬁc enzymes located in its cell membrane. Some bacterial cells can also perform photosynthesis at the cell membrane. The ribosomes in bacteria differ from ribosomes in eukaryotes in size and molecular composition, but like the ribosomes in eukaryotes, they carry out protein synthesis. In bacteria, as in eukaryotes, the cytoplasm also contains numerous enzymes that speed up reactions, such as the ones involved in digestion. Bacteria have an outer cell wall that makes them rigid and gives them shape. The cytoskeleton of prokaryotic cells serves some of the same functions as the eukaryotic cytoskeleton, but is made of different proteins. To move around, some bacteria use long tail-like structures called ﬂagella, or short hair-like ﬁbers called cilia. Although these ﬂagella and cilia may appear similar to those of eukaryotes, they are made of different proteins and produce motion by a different mechanism than that of eukaryotic cilia and ﬂagella.</bodyText><bookMarkId>56</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>56</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0057</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0057.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY182Antibiotics There are a number of antibiotics that can treat bacterial infections.

Follow the “Read, Think, and Take Note” strategy as you complete the Reading. ReadingThe Cell PrincipleEnglishman Robert Hooke was an inﬂuential scientist in the 17th century, who, while looking at thin slices of cork under a microscope, became the ﬁrst scientist to observe and record cells. What he saw in the cork looked like a series of boxes that reminded him of the rooms, or cells, of a monastery. His observations led him to call these structures cells. It was not until 1839, however, that German botanist Matthias Schleiden, from studies with a more powerful microscope, declared that entire plant organisms were made up of cells. This was a momentous discovery at the time, but within a year Schleiden’s colleague, Theodor Schwann, a professor of animal studies, proposed that animals were also made up of cells. In 1855, physician Rudolf Virchow theo-rized that new cells could only come from existing cells. The ideas of Schleiden, Schwann, and Virchow led to the development of the cell principle, which has been conﬁrmed by many scientists. The cell principle states that• all living organisms are made of cells.• cells are the basic units of structure and function in living organisms.• new cells are made from existing cells.CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION • ACTIVITY 6Robert Hooke’s drawing of cork cells, 1659</bodyText><bookMarkId>62</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>62</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0063</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0063.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY188All Cells Contain Genetic InformationAll living cells contain hereditary information in the form of a molecule called deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). From the information that is stored in DNA the cell makes the proteins and other molecules it needs to carry out all of its chemical processes and, for multicellular organisms, function within the larger organism. Based on the location of the DNA in the cell, scientists classify living cells into two major categories—eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotes are organisms with cells that contain a nucleus, a large organelle surrounded by a double membrane, where the DNA is stored. Of the organisms you have observed, animals, plants, and protists are eukaryotes. In most of the cells of multicellular eukaryotes, the nucleus contains the genetic instructions for the entire organism. Protists are s ingle-celled microbes that have a nucleus. Examples of protists are the paramecium and amoeba, most algae, and some fungi. Prokaryotes are organisms with cells that do not have a nucleus, and their DNA is located in the cytoplasm. The bacteria you observed in Activity 3, “What Is a Cell?” were single-celled prokaryotes. Prokaryotes also lack many other cell structures found in eukaryotes. All Cells Have a Cell Membrane and CytoplasmEvery living cell has a cell membrane that serves as a barrier between the cell and its environment. The cell membrane lets some substances into and out of the cell, while pre-venting the movement of other substances. Within the boundary of the cell membrane of all cells, but outside the nucleus in eukaryotes, is a semi-ﬂuid substance called the cytoplasm. All of the cell’s internal structures and organ-elles are suspended in the cytoplasm. As you will see These prokaryotic cells (a) lack a nucleus. The single chromosome is located in the cytoplasm. In the enlarged human liver cell (b), the chromo somes are inside the nucleus. ab</bodyText><bookMarkId>63</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>63</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0064</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0064.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>189CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION • ACTIVITY 6through the rest of this unit, many of the cell functions and reactions of metabolism occur in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Metabolism is the term for all of the chemical processes that maintain life and that occur within living cells.All Cells Must Maintain Internal BalanceThe external conditions in the environment surrounding cells can vary. To sur-vive, however, cells must maintain constant internal conditions, such as water content and temperature—just as a whole organism, such as a human, must do. The process by which cells maintain constant internal conditions is called homeo-stasis, and it depends greatly on the membrane’s regulation of what substances go into and out of the cell. The CytoskeletonInside the cytoplasm is a system called the cytoskeleton. As you might guess from its name, the cytoskeleton pro-vides structure and organization to the cytoplasm and maintains the shape of the cell. But the cytoskeleton has other important functions. It plays a role in the transport of materials within cells, in the division of cells, and in the movements of cells when they crawl, swim, or contract. The cytoskeleton is made of three types of long, thin structures built of proteins. These are the actin microﬁla-ments, intermediate ﬁlaments, and microtubules. These tubules and ﬁlaments are both able to assemble and disas-semble in the cell when and where they are needed. Motor proteins cause microﬁlaments and microtubules to slide past each other as well, producing shortening or length-ening movements.Cells in Multicellular Organisms SpecializeMulticellular organisms have anywhere from a few to many types of cells. In humans there are more than 220 types of cells, each with a specialized function and its own arrangement of cellular structures needed for the body to survive and reproduce. Muscle cells, for example, are specialized to contract, whether as part of the skel-etal muscles that interact with and move bones or the muscles surrounding diges-tive organs that contract to move food through your digestive system. These cells contain a highly developed system of microﬁlaments, which function to shorten the muscle cells when the muscle contracts. Muscle cells also contain many mito-chondria, which supply the large amounts of energy needed for contraction. Red blood cells, too, are specialized cells, but, unlike other human cells, they do not have nuclei, mitochondria, or other cell structures. Instead, red blood cells are packed with hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen. These cytoskeletons radiate from near the nuclei.</bodyText><bookMarkId>64</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>64</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0065</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0065.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY190A third example of specialized cells is the intestinal epithelial cells of the small intestine, which have microscopic structures called microvilli that function to increase the surface area of the cell.

One such struc-ture is the cell membrane. The cell mem-brane is the outermost membrane and the barrier between the cell and its external environment. The cell membrane supports and protects the cell. If you compare a cell to a house, the membrane of a cell functions like the out-side walls, roof, and doors of the house. It separates the cell from its environment, and helps maintain the homeostasis that lets the structures and molecules in the cell func- tion. This includes regulating amounts of vital substances in the cell, such as salts and glucose, by controlling their movements into and out of the cell. Other key roles of the cell membrane are keeping out dangerous substances and organisms, such as disease-causing microbes, and sending and receiving signals from other cells. Both infectious and noninfectious diseases may involve the cell membrane. When the membrane is unable to keep out disease-causing microbes, infection results. HIV and Plasmodium are examples of microbes that must ﬁrst interact with and enter cells in order to infect humans. Noninfectious diseases can disrupt normal membrane function. Some forms of the genetic disease muscular dystrophy, for example, prevent damaged muscle cell membranes from healing by interfering with their normal ability to reseal small tears. In this investigation you will explore a model that displays some of the features of a cell membrane.

The number of young people with diabetes is increasing especially rapidly.The WHO projects that the num- ber of people worldwide with diabetes will almost double by 2030.SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE MECHANISMDiabetes mellitus is a noninfec-tious disease that affects people of all ages and from all coun-tries. The early symptoms of diabetes include excessive urina-tion, thirst, hunger, weight loss, changes in vision, fatigue, and possibly coma. Blood glucose tests can detect diabetes in very early stages, before symptoms appear. Diabetes-related complications that may develop over a number of years include blindness, kidney failure, coro-nary heart disease, stroke, and serious infections that may lead to amputation of toes, feet, or legs. Any of these can result in disability. Diabetes disrupts the body’s ability to process sugars and is caused by a breakdown in the normal function of certain cells. There are two common types of diabetes, both of which involve high levels of glucose in the blood. The ﬁrst, Type I diabetes, occurs when the body’s immune system destroys the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, the hormone that regulates the level of glucose in the blood. Type II diabetes occurs when the body either does not produce enough insulin or speciﬁc cells are not responding to insulin. For example, the membranes of liver cells have protein receptors that recognize insulin and acti-vate the glucose transport pro-tein that moves glucose into the cell. If this process does not work, the liver cells do not take up glucose from the blood. Glu-cose builds up in the blood, and the cells cannot get the energy they need from the glucose. Both Type I and Type II diabetes disturb the normal balance of glucose within and outside the cell.

Some people with Type II diabetes require insulin shots, while others take only an oral medica-tion and follow a healthy diet. The more carefully people main-tain their blood glucose levels within the normal range, the lower the risk of serious health consequences from either type of diabetes.DIABETES PREVENTION AND TREATMENTApproximately 90% of the people around the world with diabetes have Type II diabetes. Excess body weight and lack of physical activity increase the risk of developing Type II diabetes. Previously, Type II diabetes was observed mostly in adults, but today it is becoming common in children as well. Actions people can take to help prevent or con-trol Type II diabetes include: • maintaining a healthy body weight.• exercising with moderate intensity on most days of the week.• avoiding tobacco use.Regular blood tests will detect elevated levels of blood sugar that predict Type II diabetes. This gives at-risk individuals an opportunity to take the actions described above, and reduce their chances of developing diabetes and the serious complications that may follow and reduce life expectancy. World health experts estimate that lifestyle changes by people at high risk could reduce Type II diabetes by 35 to 58%. The causes of the immune reac-tions that lead to Type I diabetes are unknown, although there is evidence that genetic and envi-ronmental factors may increase the risk of developing Type I diabetes. There are currently no preventive measures.CHALLENGES TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENTDiabetes has serious social and economic impacts on afﬂicted individuals, their families, and the health care system. These include effects on people’s ability to work and the costs of treatment. Body weight is an important indicator for the risk of Type II diabetes. Although losing weight and exercising reduce the risk of Type II diabetes—and some-times reverse its course—making lifestyle changes is difﬁcult. This is a key challenge to preventing Type II diabetes. &quot; Overweight and nonoverweight men and women in coun-tries at four average income levels.</bodyText><bookMarkId>72</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>72</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0073</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0073.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>198 8 The Cell Membrane and Diffusion A KEY FUNCTION OF the cell membrane is regulating what sub-stances enter or leave the cell. In many cases, substances move into or out of the cell through the process of diffusion. In diffusion, a substance moves from a solution with a high concen-tration of the substance to a solution with a low concentration of the substance. This is shown in the diagram at right.In this activity, you will test a variety of substances to see if they will diffuse through a model cell membrane made of plastic, rather than the detergent ﬁlm you used in Activity 7, “A Model Membrane.”’ Challenge !What factors determine whether a substance moves across a model of the cell membrane?MATERIALS FOR THE CLASS supply of 20% sucrose solution supply of 40% sucrose solutionFOR EACH GROUP OF FOUR STUDENTS4 pieces of dialysis tubing (to model the cell membrane)3 9-oz clear plastic cups 180-mL bottle of distilled water 60-mL bottle of liquid glucose solution 60-mL dropper bottle of glucose indicator 30-mL bottle of Lugol’s iodine solution 60-mL bottle of liquid starch solution 250-mL beaker 50-mL graduated cylinder2 small test tubes funnel dropper timer permanent marking pen colored pencils rulerFOR EACH STUDENT Student Sheet 2.1, “Disease Information” from Activity 2 3 sticky notes safety goggles</bodyText><bookMarkId>73</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>73</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0074</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0074.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>199THE CELL MEMBRANE AND DIFFUSION • ACTIVITY 8ProcedurePart A: Investigating Water and Sucrose Solutions 1.

Today 30 million people across the world are infected with HIV/AIDS.The distribution of cases world-wide is shown in the map below. Of the 2.7 million new cases, 370,000 are in children age 14 and younger. More than 90% of these newly infected children are babies born to mothers who are HIV positive. SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE MECHANISMIn the summer of 1981, doctors in the United States observed an unusual number of cases of a rare skin cancer and a rare pneu-monia. All of the patients had one other disease characteristic in common: reduced immunity to certain diseases. It soon became clear that some popu-lations, such as intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs, were more likely to be affected than the general U.S. popula-tion, indicating that at least one way it was acquired was from blood. The disease was named acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS). Within three years after its dis-covery, scientists showed that an infectious blood-borne virus was the cause of AIDS. They named this virus human immuno deﬁciency virus (HIV) because it reduces the function of the immune system. At ﬁrst, doc-tors and scientists hoped that the discovery of the virus would soon lead to effective vaccines for HIV/AIDS prevention. HIV, however, proved to be a rapidly mutating virus, and over a fairly short period of time, new variations of the virus emerged. Because the virus changes so rapidly, the(Continued on next page)CASE STUDY HIV/AIDSBurden of DiseaseTOTAL NUMBER INFECTEDNUMBER OF DEATHS PER YEARNUMBER OF NEW CASES PER YEARWorldwide30 million2 million2.7 millionUnited States1.1 million14,11044,000 Global distribution of HIV/AIDS cases</bodyText><bookMarkId>78</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>78</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0079</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0079.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY204(Continued from previous page)development of vaccines and treatments has been a much greater challenge than anticipated. HIV is an infectious disease that destroys a speciﬁc type of white blood cell in the immune system. The virus membrane attaches to and fuses with the cell membrane of these white blood cells. The virus appears in blood, semen, vaginal ﬂuids, and breast milk of infected individuals and is trans-mitted in one of four ways:• transfusion of infected blood.• sexual contact with an infected person.• needle or syringe contami-nated with the blood of an infected person.• an infected mother to her child during pregnancy, birth, or breast-feeding.While some people show symp-toms shortly after infection with HIV, many do not develop symp-toms for 10 years or more. Early symptoms include fatigue, fever, diarrhea, weight loss, and swollen lymph glands. The diagnosis of HIV infection is upgraded to AIDS when the patient develops at least one serious illness, such as pneumonia, TB, or hepatitis C, and that patient’s number of spe-ciﬁc white blood cells (lympho-cytes) falls below a certain level. Because the immune system also protects against cancer, HIV/AIDS increases the risk of some cancers.HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENTThere are a number of preven-tions and treatments for HIV/AIDS infection. An early inter-vention was rigorous screening of blood donors to prevent transmission of the disease from a blood transfusion. One pri-mary area of prevention today focuses on educating teenagers and adults about risky sexual activities. For example, HIV/AIDS education that promotes using condoms or abstaining from sexual activity is an effec-tive prevention measure. Pro-grams that focus on drug users and convince them not to share needles have also been effective in prevention. A major medical advance was the creation of a drug that prevents mother-to-child transmission of the virus during pregnancy and labor. Treatment of HIV/AIDS involves a combination of several drugs, which do not cure HIV/AIDS, but greatly improve the length and quality of life. In the 1990s, combina-tions of drugs, which cost about $15,000 per patient per year, became available in devel-oped countries. Then generic drugs were developed, which drove down the price of the drugs. This, along with support from organizations, made the combination drugs accessible to people in developing coun-tries at $295 per year. Today, generic drugs are available in developing countries for $88 per year.HIV/AIDS RESEARCHFor years, a major focus of HIV/AIDS research has been on a vaccine to prevent transmission of the virus. As yet, however, there is still no effective vaccine, in part because the virus evolves so rapidly.

Anti-bodies disable or kill a disease-causing microbe, such as a virus. With this type of vac-cine, the antibodies stop the infection before the person gets sick. The antibodies produced by vaccination against one vari-ation of AIDS, however, will not protect against other variations. And once a person is infected, HIV “hides” inside cells of the immune system, where anti-bodies cannot reach the virus. Research for an effective HIV/AIDS vaccine continues to be the focus for scientists who study HIV/AIDS. CHALLENGES TO HIV/AIDS PREVENTION AND TREATMENTDespite signiﬁcant progress in prevention and treatment, the global level of success in con-trolling HIV/AIDS infections worldwide has not been as high as hoped. In some places pro-viding educational programs and other preventive measures are not effective in reaching and changing the behavior of enough people to make much of a difference. Data from 64 countries show that young people, a key audience for AIDS information, do not have accu-rate and complete knowledge about HIV/AIDS. This means they are less likely to take mea-sures to prevent infection. To this date only about half of those countries have set goals for edu-cation and other prevention strategies. Additionally, many people already infected are not able to get the drugs they need because they cost too much or are not available. &quot;</bodyText><bookMarkId>80</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>80</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0081</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0081.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>206 9 Cell Membrane Structure and Function UNDERSTANDING THE CELL membrane is the key to understanding many dis-eases, and is of great value in developing treatments. Some diseases dis-able the ability of the cell membrane to reseal after it has been penetrated, and some destroy the function of the cell’s transport channels. The immune system recognizes foreign cells through receptors on the membrane of both the foreign and immune cells. Many disease-causing pathogens, such as the HIV/AIDS virus and the polio virus, infect humans by recognizing and binding to the cell mem-brane, and then entering the cell. Preventing and treating such diseases as HIV/AIDS can improve the quality and length of people’s lives and improve their social and economic well-being.Challenge !How do the structures of the cell membrane help it function?Procedure 1. When reading, answer the Stopping to Think Questions in your mind. ReadingMolecular Building Blocks of Cells and the Cell MembraneFour types of large molecules, called macromolecules, are essential building blocks for all of the structures in a cell. These macromolecules are carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Each type of macromolecule is made of one or more chains of simpler compounds, or subunits. The table below shows the kinds of subunits that make up each type of macromolecule.Macromolecule Subunits MACROMOLECULESUBUNITSCarbohydratessugarsLipidsfatty acidsProteinsamino acidsNucleic acidsnucleotides</bodyText><bookMarkId>81</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>81</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0082</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0082.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>207The cell membrane is made mostly of lipids and proteins. The lipids give the membrane its strength, yet allow it to remain ﬂex-ible and ﬂuid. The bubble ﬁlm in Activity 7, “A Model Mem-brane,” modeled the lipid layer that is the basis for the structure of the cell membrane. Most of the lipids in the cell membranes of animals, plants, protists, and bacteria are members of a special class of lipids, called phospho lipids. A phospholipid is a lipid with a phosphate head attached to two long lipid tails. The structure of the membrane results from the properties of the phospholipids. The heads of phos-pholipid molecules are attracted to water, so they face the watery environment inside and outside the cell. The tails line up and point toward the middle of the membrane. This results in a double-layered structure called a phospholipid (lipid) bilayer, as shown at right.Proteins are embedded in the membrane’s phospholipid bilayer, also shown at right. Some of these proteins are linked to carbohydrate chains. Membrane proteins are able to move sideways through the membrane, just as you were able to move tubes through the bubble membrane. The complex arrangement of proteins in the membrane reminded scientists of the tiles in a mosaic. This led scientists to refer to the structure of the cell membrane as a ﬂuid mosaic model, shown below.There are many proteins in the membrane of a typical cell. One kind of pro tein acts as channels or pumps, controlling what enters and leaves the cell. You modeled these channels when you inserted straws and tubes through the bubble membrane. You also modeled the glucose channel with the dialysis membrane.

These molecules are involved in cell-to-cell communication. An example of a receptor is the membrane protein that binds to insulin hormone. The body needs insulin to regulate blood glucose levels. When blood glucose levels are high, insulin attaches to receptors in the mem-branes of liver and muscle cells. This stimulates the cells to take up glucose from the blood and store it as glycogen or fat. STOPPING TO THINK 1What are the molecular building blocks that make up the cell membrane?How are these molecules arranged in the cell membrane?What are the functions of these molecules in the membrane?The Cell Membrane Controls What Enters and Leaves the CellDIFFUSION AND OSMOSISThe cell membrane is semipermeable, or selectively permeable, which means not all substances can cross it. This property helps the cell maintain homeostasis—stable internal conditions—by controlling what enters and leaves. You modeled this property of the membrane with the dialysis tubing in the last activity: small mole-cules, like water and glucose, could cross the dialysis membrane, while large mol-ecules, like sucrose and starch, could not. Size is one factor that determines whether a molecule can cross the cell membrane. Other factors determining whether cer-tain molecules can cross a cell membrane are the molecules’ shape and electrical charge.For the cell to function properly, it must allow desirable substances, such as nutri-ents, to enter, and allow wastes to leave. Many of these substances enter and leave the cell by diffusing from an area of high concentration to an area of low con-centration. When a substance moves naturally from high to low concentration, the cell does not have to expend energy. For example, oxygen diffuses from a high concentration outside the cell across the membrane into the cell. As the oxygen is used up and the concentration in the cell drops, more oxygen enters the cell. Similarly, as carbon dioxide builds up inside the cells of the body it diffuses from high concentration across the cell membrane to lower concentration outside of the cell. Water also diffuses naturally in both directions across the cell membrane. The overall direction of movement of water depends on the concentration of dissolved substances inside and outside the cell. Diffusion will continue until the two solutions have an equal concentration of the dissolved substance. When a cell is placed in a</bodyText><bookMarkId>83</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>83</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0084</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0084.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>209CELL MEMBRANE STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION • ACTIVITY 9solution with a higher concentration of dissolved sub-stances, water will move out of the cell, and the cell will shrink, as shown in the diagram at right. When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower concentration of dis-solved substances, water will enter the cell and the cell will swell. This diffusion of liquid water across a semi-permeable membrane is called osmosis. PASSIVE TRANSPORTNot all substances used or produced by the cell can freely diffuse through its mem-brane, especially substances that are electrically charged or are very large in size. Proteins in the cell membrane must transport the substances in or out. When a mem brane protein moves a substance from higher to lower concentration through a protein channel, the process is called facilitated diffusion, or passive transport, because it does not require energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is the move-ment of glucose from high concentrations outside the cell into the cell through a glucose transport protein.ACTIVE TRANSPORTIn some cases, proteins transport substances into or out of a cell against the normal direction of diffusion. The molecules of the substance are moving from low to high concentration. This process is called active transport (shown below), and it requires the cell to expend energy. An example of active transport is the pumping of substances like calcium and sodium out of the cell. The active transport of a substance from low to high concentration requires energy.</bodyText><bookMarkId>84</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>84</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0085</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0085.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY210ExocytosisEndocytosisTRANSPORT BY VESICLESSometimes materials are transported across the cell membrane by vesicles, which are small compartments surrounded by a membrane. To transport materials into the cell, the membrane forms a pocket that then pinches into the cell, forming a vesicle. This formation and movement of vesicles into the cell is called endocytosis. To transport materials out of the cell, a vesicle in the cytoplasm fuses with the cell membrane, and re-forms a smooth outer membrane, releasing its contents to the outside. This pro-cess of releasing material in vesicles to the outside of the cell is called exocytosis. Both of these processes are shown below. The ﬂuid nature of the membrane is key to its ability to form and release vesicles.

Why?Viruses and the Cell MembraneThe causes of many human infectious diseases are viruses that enter our cells. HIV/AIDS is a well-known example. Like all viruses, HIV/AIDS is not made of cells, and is not capable of producing offspring on its own. Instead, a virus must invade a cell in order to reproduce. Viruses can infect cells in plants and animals, and can even infect bacteria. A virus is mainly composed of its genetic material and a few proteins, surrounded by a protein coat, and sometimes a lipid membrane. To make copies of itself, the virus invades a cell and uses the cell’s structures. Because of this, the invaded cell is called a host cell. Most viruses don’t infect every type of cell in the body. Instead, each virus infects one or a few types of cells. HIV/AIDS, for example, only infects cells of the immune system. When the virus comes into con-tact with an immune system cell, it must ﬁrst cross the cell membrane. If the virus does not cross that ﬁrst barrier, it does not infect the cell, cannot produce more viruses, and will eventually be destroyed.STOPPING TO THINK 3What makes a virus different from a bacterial or animal cell?Why do viruses need host cells?Viruses can infect many sorts of organisms, including animals, plants, and bac-teria. They attach to a cell by interacting with the lipids, proteins, or carbohydrates of the cell membrane. Some viruses, such as those that infect bacteria, invade a cell by making a hole in the membrane and injecting themselves into the cell through the hole. Other viruses, like HIV, have an external membrane similar to the cell’s membrane. The virus membrane fuses with the cell membrane, allowing the virus to enter the cell. Still other viruses, such as ﬂu viruses, get a “free ride” into the cell through the cell’s endocytosis mechanism. In endocytosis the part of the cell mem-brane in contact with the virus surrounds the virus and pinches into the cell, in a process similar to the one shown on the previous page. Once the virus is inside the cell it will use others of the cell’s structures to make more viruses. These new viruses then exit the cell in one of two ways: 1) by pinching off, or budding, from the host cell without destroying the host cell, as is the case with HIV/AIDS; or 2) by breaking the host cell open, killing it in the process, as is the case with polio virus.</bodyText><bookMarkId>86</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>86</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0087</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0087.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY212Analysis 1.

A protein is a macro-molecule made up of one or more chains of amino acids folded together into a complex three-dimensional structure. Each protein performs a certain function, such as speeding up a chemical reaction, transporting a speciﬁc mole-cule into or out of the cell, or ﬁghting disease. The information for producing all of the proteins a cell needs is stored in the cell’s DNA. In eukaryotes the DNA is located in the nucleus, and in prokaryotes it is in the cytoplasm. The genetic material of viruses is enclosed by a protein coat, or capsid. Viruses must have such proteins to be able to infect human cells, and they stimulate a body’s immune-system response.

On the other hand, when the body’s immune system is activated, immune cells engulf the pathogen and use enzymes to digest it. Enzymes are required for the majority of reactions and activities that take place within cells. An enzyme is a type of protein that speeds up, or catalyzes, a speciﬁc chemical reaction. Each enzyme has a region called a binding site, which has a unique shape that matches the shape of the reactant it interacts with. Any factor that changes the binding site can reduce or prevent the action of the enzyme. In this activity you will design, conduct, and report on an investigation to determine whether pH and temperature affect the function of the enzyme lactase. Lactase is a digestive enzyme found in the small intestine of humans. When people consume lactose, which is a sugar found in milk, lactase breaks down the lactose into two simple sugars, glucose and galactose. Both simple sugars are readily absorbed by your body. lactase lactose ! water &amp; glucose ! galactoseSome people’s bodies no longer produce lactase, and so they can no longer break down the lactose in milk or foods that contain milk. Instead, bacteria that live naturally in the small intestine consume the lactose. A product of the digestion of lactose by bacteria is carbon dioxide gas, which can cause abdominal pain. When diarrhea also occurs, doctors may suspect that these are symptoms of lactose deﬁ- ciency in a condition called lactose intolerance.

Without energy, metabo-lism—all of the chemical reactions that occur within cells—will not occur. In this activity, you will learn how the complex chemical reactions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration help meet the energy needs of living things. You will examine the organelles, molecules, and chemical reactions involved in these two processes. You will also learn how a microbe or chemical that disrupts one or more of the steps of photo synthesis or cellular respiration causes disease.Challenge !How do photosynthesis and cellular respiration meet the energy needs of all organisms?

Cellular respiration is the process by which cells break down complex molecules, such as sugars, to release energy. Some of the energy is released as heat while the rest is stored temporarily in other molecules, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is used when the cell needs energy. For example, whenever your muscles contract, ATP supplies the energy. As you also learned in the “Ecology” unit, photosynthesis is the process by which the cells of producers capture the sun’s energy and store it in sugars. All producers and consumers ultimately depend on these sugars for their energy needs.The following equations summarize the two processes.Cellular respiration: sugars ! oxygen &amp; carbon dioxide ! water ! energyPhotosynthesis: carbon dioxide ! water ! light energy &amp; sugars ! oxygenAs you can see from the equations, the components of cellular respiration and photosynthesis are nearly identical. In fact, cellular respiration is often described as the opposite of photosynthesis. The two processes, however, are far more com-plex than the equations indicate.PHOTOSYNTHESISPhotosynthesis only occurs in certain pigment-containing cells of producers. This differs from cellular respiration, which occurs in all types of cells in all organisms. A pigment is a molecule that absorbs light energy. All producers contain pigments, which are essential for photosynthesis. The most common pigment in producers is chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is what makes the stems and leaves of producers green. In most producers the chlorophyll is contained in chloroplasts.Light micrograph of Elodea cells</bodyText><bookMarkId>95</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>95</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0096</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0096.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>221PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION • ACTIVITY 12Chloroplasts are relatively large organelles surrounded by two membranes. Chloro-plasts absorb energy from sunlight, as shown in the diagram below. Inside the chloroplast is a ﬂuid-ﬁlled space called the stroma and stacks of connected mem-brane sacs called thylakoids. The thylakoid membranes contain the chlorophyll, and the stacked structure greatly increases the membrane surface area that can absorb light.Mitochondria are present in both plants and animal cells, while chloroplasts are present only in plant cells.</bodyText><bookMarkId>96</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>96</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0097</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0097.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY222THE REACTIONS OF PHOTOSYNTHESISThe reactions occurring in photosynthesis are grouped into two stages, light- dependent and light-independent reactions. The light-dependent reactions rely on chlorophyll and other pigments in the thylakoid membranes to harness the energy of light. In a complex series of reactions, water breaks down into oxygen, hydrogen ions (protons), and electrons. Each reaction requires a unique enzyme. The oxygen is released to the atmosphere, some of the energy from the reactions goes into making ATP from ADP, and the protons and electrons combine with the carrier molecule, NADP+, to form NADPH. The NADPH and ATP are important to the light-independent Calvin cycle, which is a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions that take place in the stroma of the chloro-plast. During these reactions carbon dioxide combines with the hydrogen ions and electrons produced from water during the light-dependent reactions. This results in the production of the high-energy sugar glucose. The glucose is used in cellular respiration or is converted to another form, such as starch, and stored for later use. Starch is a type of carbo hydrate. A starch macromolecule is made of many glucose molecules linked together.</bodyText><bookMarkId>97</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>97</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0098</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0098.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>223PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION • ACTIVITY 12The reactions in the Calvin cycle occur in the presence or absence of light and are referred to as light-independent reactions. During the Calvin cycle ATP and NADPH are converted back into ADP and NADP+. These will be used again in the light-dependent reactions in the thylakoid membranes. The reactions of the Calvin cycle continue as long as carbon dioxide, ATP, NADPH, and enzymes are present. Certain plant diseases, such as the plum pox virus that attacks several kinds of fruit trees, inhibit enzymes involved in the Calvin cycle. This prevents the plant from making the sugar it needs to support cellular respiration. Trees infected with plum pox may eventually stop producing fruit. Organisms that feed off the fruit may need to ﬁnd another food source, and communities that rely on fruit sales may suffer economically.CELLULAR RESPIRATIONEach reaction in cellular respiration also requires a unique enzyme, and, as in photosynthesis, diseases or poisons may reduce the activity of these enzymes. This can have serious consequences for an organism, since cellular respiration is the process by which energy is released for cells to use. It is important not to confuse cellular respiration with breathing, which is often called respiration. Breathing gets oxygen into your lungs, but the oxygen has no purpose until it enters your cells and plays its part in cellular respiration.</bodyText><bookMarkId>98</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>98</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0099</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0099.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY224In prokaryotes, such as bacteria, the reactions of cellular respiration that require oxygen occur on the cell membrane. In eukaryotes, these reactions take place in the cells’ mitochondria. Mitochondria are organelles that have two membranes, an outer membrane and an inner membrane that is folded within the outer, which play central roles in the reactions of cellular respiration. The outer membrane contains specialized proteins that make the membrane very permeable to ions and small molecules. The inner membrane is less permeable, but it contains transport proteins to allow for the passage of some molecules. The inner membrane also contains enzymes needed for cellular respiration. The inner membrane is folded to form many cristae, ﬁnger-like projections that provide a large surface area for the reactions of cellular respiration. Inside a mitochondrion is a space called the matrix.THE REACTIONS OF CELLULAR RESPIRATIONCellular respiration begins with the process of glycolysis. Glycolysis means “the breaking of sugar.” This ﬁrst step takes place in the cytoplasm. In glycolysis, the energy from ATP breaks a glucose molecule, releasing hydrogen ions and creating two smaller molecules of pyruvic acid. The carrier molecule, NAD+, combines with these hydrogen ions and with electrons to form NADH. Glycolysis also produces new ATP molecules, resulting in a net gain of 2 ATP molecules for each molecule of glucose that is broken down. If oxygen is present, the pyruvic acid molecules produced during glycolysis are then further broken down, releasing large amounts of energy in a process called aerobic respiration. In eukaryotic cells, the pyruvic acid molecules ﬁrst enter the mitochondrion where they are stripped of a carbon atom and are also temporarily</bodyText><bookMarkId>99</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>99</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0100</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0100.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>225PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION • ACTIVITY 12combined with the enzyme helper, coenzyme A. This combination, called acetyl CoA, becomes part of the next stage of cellular respiration, the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle takes place in the matrix of the mitochondrion. In the Krebs cycle the acetyl CoA breaks down and releases coenzyme A and pyruvic acid. The carbon atoms of the pyruvic acid end up in carbon dioxide, which is released as waste. Two molecules of ATP are produced and the carrier molecules NAD+ and FAD+ pick up electrons and hydrogen ions to form NADH and FADH, respectively. These are transferred by the carriers to the cristae of the mitochondria’s inner membranes to take part in the ﬁnal stage of cellular respi-ration, the electron transport chain.During this stage, electrons and hydrogen ions are released when NADH and FADH, are converted back to NAD+ and FAD+. In a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, electrons combine with hydrogen ions and oxygen to make water, which then leaves the mitochondrion. The movement of electrons through the electron transport chain releases energy, which converts 32 more molecules of ADP into ATP. Aerobic respiration, therefore, produces a total of 36 ATP molecules for each glucose molecule. Since the reactions of the electron transport chain need oxygen, they will stop if oxygen is not available, which prevents the Krebs cycle from operating. Some organisms do not need oxygen for cellular respiration and instead use a pro-cess called anaerobic respiration. This process also occurs for short periods of time in muscle cells when insufﬁcient oxygen is present to conduct aerobic respi-ration. Anaerobic respiration, also known as fermentation, takes place in the</bodyText><bookMarkId>100</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>100</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0101</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0101.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY226cytoplasm of a cell. There are two types of fermentation: lactate fermentation and alcoholic fermentation. In lactate fermentation the pyruvic acid that is produced by glycolysis is changed into a form of lactic acid. This is the type of anaerobic respiration that occurs in muscle cells. However, anaerobic respiration does not sustain muscle cells for very long: as lactic acid builds up, fatigue and muscle cramps result. This same process in bacteria causes food to spoil, and with certain bacteria such fermentation allows us to make cheese and yogurt. In alcoholic fermentation, shown in the ﬁgure below, pyruvic acid reacts with water to form acetaldehyde and release carbon dioxide. (When yeast is added to bread dough, alcoholic fermentation releases carbon dioxide, which helps the bread to rise.) In the presence of electrons and hydrogen ions that have been transported by NADH the acetaldehyde is then converted into ethanol. This is the same process that occurs, for example, when energy companies convert corn into the biofuel ethanol and when people make wine from grapes. During fermentation there is a net gain of only two molecules of ATP. When com-pared to the net gain of 32 ATP molecules produced during the Krebs cycle and the electron transport chain stage, it is clear that aerobic respiration provides much more energy to cells than does anaerobic respiration.</bodyText><bookMarkId>101</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>101</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0102</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0102.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>227PHOTOSYNTHESIS AND CELLULAR RESPIRATION • ACTIVITY 12Some diseases and toxins disrupt cellular respiration in plants and animals. For example, powdery mildew fungus and cyanide both inhibit the electron transport chain. Powdery mildew causes premature death of infected plants, and cyanide is highly toxic to organisms that respire aerobically. Some genetic disorders involve mutations in certain enzymes of cellular respiration. In lactate dehydrogenase deﬁ-ciency, for example, the enzyme that converts pyruvic acid to lactic acid is affected, which causes fatigue, and muscle damage if the afﬂicted person exercises intensely. Diabetes can also disrupt respiration. If insulin levels become too low, cells don’t get enough glucose to meet their cellular respiration needs, and the body switches to fat as an energy source. As fat is broken down to be used for cellular respiration, a by-product of the process builds up and makes the blood acidic. This condition can lead to coma and death. Analysis 1.

The complete sequence of phases from the end of one cell division to the end of the next is called the cell cycle. The cell cycle is divided into a sequence of four phases, shown in the diagram below. One of these four phases, called mitosis, is the stage at which the cell divides to produce two new—or offspring—cells.A group of cell-cycle control proteins regulates the phases of the cell cycle to ensure that all events needed for normal cell division take place before division begins. Cell-cycle regulation also ensures that speciﬁc cell types divide at the right time and place. For example, in the human body red blood cells must be replaced about every 120 days. If the stem cells that differentiate into red blood cells become under- or over-active, either too few or too many red blood cells are produced. Regulation of the cell cycle also ensures that a cell completes the growth and synthesis phases so that it will divide properly. When cell growth and division proceed abnormally, cancer might result.

Scientists have made great prog-ress in understanding, treating, and curing many types of cancer, but much about cancer is still unknown.Cancer affects people living in all areas of the world, at all income levels. It usually develops over several years and has various causes, some environmental and some internal. SYMPTOMS AND DISEASE MECHANISMThe term cancer refers to more than 100 diseases that result when cells lose the normal con-trols that regulate their growth and division in the cell cycle. These cells continuously divide even when no new cells are needed. In most types of cancer, as an original cancer cell divides through multiple cell cycles, a mass of cells develops to form a tumor. However, some types of cancer, such as leukemia, rarely produce tumors. Leukemia results when abnormal white blood cells are produced too rap-idly or do not die within the normal lifetime of white blood cells. These cells crowd the blood and prevent normal blood cells from performing their functions. Mutations, or errors, in some genes can cause cancer. Some of these genes normally stimulate cell division, while others normally stop cell division. Mutations in these genes can lead to unregulated cell growth and division that result in tumors. Cervical cancer is an example of a cancer that is linked to an infection from a virus, in this case human papillomavirus (HPV). Women worldwide are at risk of being infected by this sexually transmitted virus. There are more than 100 types of HPV, about 30 types infect the genital regions of men and women, and a few have been shown to cause cervical cancer in women.(Continued on next page)CASE STUDYCancerBurden of DiseaseNUMBER OF NEW CASES PER YEARNUMBER OF DEATHS PER YEARWorldwide14 million8 millionUnited States1.7 million580,000 Projected deaths from cancer as a percentage of all deaths for all ages at four income levels, 2005 (left)Normal skin (below left) and cancerous skin (below right)</bodyText><bookMarkId>108</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>108</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0109</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0109.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY234(Continued from previous page)Cancer sometimes develops when environmental factors or viruses interact with certain genes to cause mutations. Environmental factors that lead to cancer include exposure to such chemicals as tobacco smoke, air pollutants, and asbestos. The chemicals pro-duced when tobacco burns put people who smoke, and who are regularly exposed to tobacco smoke, at a higher risk of devel-oping lung cancer than non-smokers. In fact, approximately 10%–15% of smokers develop lung cancer, and smokers are 10–20 times more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers. Other environmental factors, including various kinds of radia-tion, also cause cancer. CANCER PREVENTIONS AND TREATMENTThe World Health Organization reports that approximately 30% of cancer cases could be pre-vented by addressing such risk factors as:• tobacco use• being overweight or obese• lack of physical activity• lack of fruits and vegetables in the diet• alcohol abuse• sexually transmitted HPV infection • urban air pollution• indoor smoke from household use of solid fuels, such as woodThere are a number of programs and a few vaccines that help people reduce or eliminate their risk factors for cancer. The table below shows examples. The main ways that cancers are treated are surgery, chemo- therapy, radiation therapy, or a combination of those. Surgeries to treat cancer include removing the tumor and surrounding tis-sues, removing the tumor and the organ it is in, and sometimes removing lymph nodes where the cancer may have spread. Sur-geons also might remove just part of a tumor to relieve pain or open any blockages the tumor is causing. Chemotherapy involves taking certain drugs that kill cells, including cancer cells. Chemo-therapy might follow surgery or be used alone or in combi-nation with radiation therapy, A diet high in fat and calories and low in fruits and vegetables, as shown at far left, increases a person’s risk of developing some cancers, as compared to the diet shown at near left.

Radia-tion therapy directs X-rays or other high-energy particles to the area of the tumor to damage the genetic material inside the cancer cells and kill them. Normal cells in the radiated area are some-times damaged but are usu-ally replaced by division of the normal cells that remain.CHALLENGES TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENTChallenges vary depending on the type of cancer. It is often dif-ﬁcult for people to avoid or con-trol environmental risk factors for cancer simply because some of these factors are found in the environment. For example, sev-eral industrial chemicals have been associated with increased lung cancer risk, including asbestos, arsenic, nickel, chro-mium, zinc, and radon. People might be exposed to these chemi-cals in their work environment or home. Research suggests that up to 15% of lung cancer cases in men and 5% in women are due to occupational hazards. Also, many people cannot avoid expo-sure to air pollution if they live in urban areas where pollution levels are high. And for many people, making a behavioral change, such as quitting smoking, is very hard to do.While screening may detect cancer early, it can only be effec-tive if there is a treatment strategy for that cancer. Also, for many cancers, cost-effective early diag-nostic tests have not yet been developed. The drawbacks of chemotherapy and radiation therapy are that they kill many normal cells, not just cancer cells. Fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, loss of appetite, and hair loss are just some of the side effects that might be mild or severe, depending on the drugs and course of radiation. Although cancer might strike anyone, poor people in low- income developing countries have a lower chance of surviving the disease than those in higher-income countries. The preven-tions and treatments available for cancer are often too expensive in the lower-income countries, and there may be few, if any, acces-sible hospitals or health care pro-fessionals capable of providing the care needed. &quot;</bodyText><bookMarkId>110</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>110</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0111</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0111.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>236 14 Stem Cell DifferentiationThe development of special-ized cells from stem cells. THE HUMAN BODY is made of many kinds of specialized cells. Red blood cells, white blood cells, muscle cells, nerve cells, and skin cells are just some examples. Each specialized cell performs a function in the body. You have learned about several conditions that result when cells don’t function normally. Diabetes damages the cells in the pancreas that make insulin. Sickle cell disease is a genetic condition that alters the functioning of the hemoglobin protein in red blood cells. And many kinds of cells may become cancerous when they lose their normal cell cycle controls.Every cell in your body is the offspring of another cell and has the same genetic material as the fertilized egg from which it developed. It is amazing that the many different types of cells all arise from a single fertilized egg cell. Yet that is what hap-pens during embryo development. Initially, all the cells in the embryo are alike. But as they divide, they become more specialized and produce their own charac-teristic proteins. Cells that have the ability to produce a variety of types of special-ized cells are called stem cells. The process by which stem cells produce specialized cells is called differentiation. As differentiation progresses, segments of the genetic material are either activated or suppressed. You have probably heard about stem cell research in the news. This is an impor-tant area of cutting-edge research. Once we understand exactly how a human develops from a single cell to a multicellular organism we might learn how certain conditions, such as some birth defects, and diseases, such as cancer, develop. Researchers around the world are trying to ﬁgure out how stem cells might be used to replace diseased or damaged tissues in any number of diseases.</bodyText><bookMarkId>111</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>111</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0112</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0112.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>237STEM CELL DIFFERENTIATION • ACTIVITY 14 In this activity, you will learn about the differentiation of human stem cells.

BECAUSE OF THEIR ability to differentiate into multiple cell types, stem cells hold the potential to treat a variety of human diseases. In fact, several stem cell-based treatments are already in widespread use, including bone marrow transplantation and umbilical-cord-blood stem cell therapy. One area of stem cell research, however, has generated a major social controversy. This is research per-formed with human embryonic stem cells.

Read the information below about stem cells, and then complete the Learned column of your KWL.ReadingSeveral Types of Stem CellsIn the previous activity, you learned that stem cells often differentiate through multiple cell cycles to produce a variety of types of specialized cells. A human fer-tilized egg, or zygote, can produce cells that differentiate into every kind of spe-cialized human cell. This means the zygote is totipotent, totally capable. When the zygote ﬁrst begins dividing, its cells form a hollow ball, called a blastocyst. The inner cells of this blastocyst will form most types of human cells, and are called pluripotent embryonic stem cells.</bodyText><bookMarkId>116</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>116</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0117</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0117.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY242Unlike embryonic stem cells, the stem cells in a human adult—or a child or infant—can differentiate into only a limited number of kinds of cells and are usually found within the tissues that they will renew. Stem cells found in our bone marrow, for example, can form many types of blood cells, but not muscle or nervous tissue cells. These multipotent stem cells have a multiple, but limited, potential.Stem Cell Therapy TodayA frequently used stem cell therapy, bone marrow transplantation, involves injecting blood stem cells from a healthy donor into the bone marrow of a recip-ient with a blood disease, such as leukemia. Leukemias are a group of cancers that cause an overproduction of white blood cells. The recipient is ﬁrst treated with radiation and chemotherapy to kill all of the unhealthy bone marrow and blood cells before receiving blood-forming cells from the donor. These cells may be obtained from the donor’s bone marrow or circulating blood. There are a number of risks to this procedure, including an immune system attack on the donor cells.Umbilical cord stem cells are also used to treat leukemia. Like an adult’s stem cells, they are multipotent, but they are less likely than fully developed stem cells to cause an immune response in the recipient. The Potential of Stem Cells for the FutureMany diseases are caused by a problem with one particular cell type. These are the diseases that are current or potential targets for stem cell therapy. One possible target for adult stem cell therapy is diabetes. In Type-I diabetes, the afﬂicted per-son’s immune system attacks cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, the protein hormone necessary for metabolizing sugars. One approach to treating this disease is to kill the person’s immune cells with radiation or chemotherapy, and then pro-vide adult stem cells that will restore a healthy immune system. A group of scien-tists has reported promising results from trying this treatment on a small number of diabetes patients. This treatment is highly experimental, and even if the results hold up over time, there are risks involved. Embryonic stem cells can become any type of specialized cells. They are also easier to obtain than some types of adult stem cells, most of which are not easily located and isolated. For these reasons, embryonic stem cells might allow more rapid development of effective treatments.One area of potential is treating neurological diseases, such as Parkinson’s disease. In Parkinson’s, the nerve cells in the brain that make the chemical dopamine stop functioning, and the person loses the ability to move properly and might eventu-ally develop mental impairments. If these cells could be replaced in some way, it might relieve the symptoms or cure the disease. Because stable adult nerve cell lines are difﬁcult to produce, using pluripotent embryonic stem cells might allow researchers to ﬁnd cures more quickly.</bodyText><bookMarkId>117</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>117</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0118</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0118.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>243STEM CELL RESEARCH • ACTIVITY 15The Stem Cell Debate Working with stem cells from developed humans is not generally a controversial area of scientiﬁc research, but it is more complicated than starting with an embry-onic stem cell that might be steered in any direction to re-create specialized cells. In contrast, embryonic stem cell research involves getting an early-stage embryo from a fertility clinic and isolating individual cells. This destroys the embryo. Although the cells of those embryos have not yet begun to differentiate into the specialized cells that will turn into a functioning human being, some people object to destroying any embryo because of its potential to develop into a human being. Another method being researched for creating embryonic stem cells is to take a human egg, remove its nucleus, and insert an adult cell nucleus from the person to be treated. This produces an embryonic stem cell with the same genetic makeup as the recipient, lowering the chance of an immune reaction to the stem cells. How-ever, the same ethical considerations apply.Analysis 1. What kinds of questions can scientists answer about stem cells? 2.

They contain genetic material and a few proteins, but they do not conduct cellular functions. For example, a virus can neither metabolize nutrients needed to grow and to develop essential structures, nor can it reproduce on its own. To reproduce, a virus must infect a living host cell. Viruses are speciﬁc to their hosts. Some infect one kind of animal, while others infect plants or even bacteria. Once it is inside the host cell, the virus takes over the cell’s structures, enzymes, and organelles that will enable it to reproduce.

Therefore, safe water, sanitation, and refrigeration of food are important for controlling rota-virus transmission. ROTAVIRUS PREVENTION AND TREATMENTExclusive breastfeeding is a strategy for preventing diarrheal infections, including rotavirus, in infants up to six months old. Exclusive breastfeeding means the baby ingests no food or drink besides its mother’s breast milk. The baby is allowed vita-mins, minerals, or medicines, but no water. Breast milk con-tains nutrients, antibodies, and other elements that boost the immune system, and breast-feeding eliminates the need for infants to eat food or take in drink that may be contaminated. In 2007, a vaccine became avail-able to prevent rotavirus infec-tion, and widespread distribution of the vaccine could be a major boost for prevention of the disease. The World Health Organi zation now recommends rota virus vaccine be adminis-tered to infants as soon as pos-sible after six weeks of age. The maps on the following page show the ﬁrst countries to introduce the vaccine and the approxi-mately 80 countries that had introduced the vaccine by the end of 2015. Studies of the impact of the vaccine show sig-niﬁcant reductions in hospital-izations and deaths. Currently, there is no drug treatment for rotavirus infec-tion. Only oral or intravenous rehydra tion with electrolytes is prescribed. This maintains homeostasis of water and salts in the blood. CHALLENGES TO PREVENTION AND TREATMENTFor HIV-positive mothers, breastfeeding is not a good option for preventing rotavirus in their infants because breast milk can transmit HIV. In these cases it is safer to feed babies a breast milk replacement, such as infant formula. But with for-mula, the baby does not get the antibodies to protect against diseases that breast milk would carry from mother to child. Currently there are two major roadblocks to global use of a rotavirus vaccine.

Understanding human cells, microbes, and disease mechanisms helps people make informed deci-sions about where and how to focus efforts in combating the diseases. In this activity, you will compare various interven-tions for diseases, and the trade-offs of these inter-ventions. A disease intervention is a method used to prevent, treat, or eradicate a disease. For example, improving sanitation or vaccinating children prevents rotavirus infection. If a child is infected, giving the child ﬂuids to keep him or her hydrated until recovery is another kind of disease intervention.

As you have learned in this unit, social, economic, and environmental conse-quences of diseases vary by country, and by region. Such variations create complications when deciding how to allocate funding for dis-ease interventions. For example, if funding were so limited that there was a choice between dedicating it all to cancer research or directing it to several less costly interventions that would prevent thousands of children from dying of malaria or rotavirus, what is the best decision?Currently a private foundation, whose mission is to fund projects that address problems related to world health, is about to review project proposals. Proposals must relate to prevention or treatment of one of the six global diseases you have studied—malaria, tuberculosis, dia-betes, HIV/AIDS, cancer, and rotavirus.

Without a healthy population and environmental, social, and eco-nomic conditions that allow children to experience a normal lifespan, a commu-nity may not be able to sustain itself. Disease interventions are actions taken to prevent or treat diseases, and they vary in effectiveness, cost, and ease of implementation.Diseases are classiﬁed as infectious or noninfectious. Infectious diseases are trans-mitted from person to person either directly or by another organism, called a vector. Noninfectious diseases are instead caused by such factors as aging, the environment, behavior, genetics, or a combination of these. Less-developed coun-tries tend to have a greater proportion of deaths from infectious diseases than do more-developed countries. Some human diseases are caused by abnormalities that develop within the body’s cells, while others are caused by microbes. Some dis-eases, including sickle cell disease and malaria, are diagnosed by viewing blood samples from the affected individual through a light microscope.

All cells maintain homeostasis, a range of internal conditions that allows the cell to live and function. The structure and organization of cells and internal cell parts are essential for the cell to trans-form and release energy needed for cellular functions. The molecules in a cell form a variety of specialized structures, or organelles, to perform such cell functions as energy production, transport of molecules, waste disposal, synthesis of new mol-ecules, and storage of genetic material. Bacterial cells have neither a nucleus nor other membrane-bound organelles. Multi cellular organisms have specialized cells with an arrangement of structures that accomplish a specialized function.A cell has a membrane that surrounds it and separates it from the outside envi-ronment. The cell membrane is a ﬂuid mosaic of molecules, made mainly of phos-pholipids and proteins, which gives the cell ﬂexibility and strength and controls what enters and leaves the cell. In addition to a cell membrane, plant cells have a cell wall that provides support and additional protection. A cell also has a cytoplasm that contains a mixture of thousands of molecules. Within the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell is a cytoskeleton that provides support and structure for the cell. The cytoplasm of all cells (and the nucleus of eukary-otes) is the site of the reactions of metabolism. Nearly all cells contain genetic information. In eukaryotes, the genetic information is stored in the nucleus.

Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. The diffusion of a liquid, such as water, across a membrane is called osmosis. Some substances diffuse freely across cell membranes, while others must enter through protein channels in a process called facilitated diffusion. Some substances are trans-ported into the cell by transport proteins against, or up, a concentration gradient. This process requires the cell to expend energy and is called active transport. KEY VOCABULARYactive transport osmosisdiffuse, diffusion passive transportendocytosis phospholipid (lipid) bilayerexocytosis selectively permeablefacilitated diffusion semipermeablefluid mosaic model transport proteinlipid vesiclemacromoleculeProteins To support life cells need thousands of proteins, each with a specialized function. Cellular organelles, structures, and enzymes make the proteins cells require. The genetic information stored in DNA directs the synthesis of those proteins. Proteins are often classiﬁed according to their functions. Enzymes, for example, are a large group of proteins that act as biological catalysts to speed up the chemical reactions in cells. Enzymes’ structures and functions are affected by such factors as tempera-ture and pH.Receptor proteins and enzymes are also a virus’s key to entering a cell, repro-ducing itself, and spreading infection. The HIV virus, as well as other viruses, is not a cell and cannot reproduce on its own. When HIV infects a cell, it uses the host’s cell organelles and proteins to make more HIV viruses.</bodyText><bookMarkId>131</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>131</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0132</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0132.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>257UNIT REVIEW • CELL BIOLOGYKEY VOCABULARYbinding site pHcatalyze proteinenzyme receptorlactase receptor proteinlactose signaling proteinmotor proteinPhotosynthesis and Cellular RespirationThe energy for life comes primarily from the sun. The structure and organization of cells and internal cell parts transform and release the energy an organism needs for cellular functions. Some plant cells contain chloroplasts, the sites of photosyn-thesis. In photosynthesis, plants capture energy by absorbing light and using it to form chemical bonds between the atoms of carbon-containing molecules. The chemical bonds of food molecules store energy. Energy is released when the bonds of food molecules are rearranged in the reactions of cellular respiration to form new compounds. Cells temporarily store the energy released by cellular respira-tion in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) molecules.KEY VOCABULARYadenosine triphosphate (ATP) light-dependent reactionsaerobic respiration light-indepedent reactionsanaerobic respiration matrixCalvin cycle mitochondriacellular respiration mitochondrionchloroplast organellecristae photosynthesiselectron transport chain pigmentglycolysis stromaKrebs cycle thylakoids</bodyText><bookMarkId>132</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>132</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0133</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0133.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • CELL BIOLOGY258Cell Growth, Division, and DifferentiationCell functions are regulated to control and coordinate cell growth and division. The cell cycle is the complete sequence of phases from the end of one cell division to the end of the next. Some types of cells, including blood and skin cells, divide more often than other types, such as liver and nerve cells. When normal cell regu-lation is disrupted, serious consequences, such as cancer, may result. Stem cells produce a variety of specialized cells.

Virtually all countries in the world mandate use of the metric system exclusively. e United States does not use the metric system for many measurements, although it has been the standard for the scientiﬁc community in the United States for more than 200 years. A U.S. government eﬀort to convert from the United States customary system to metric measurements in all realms of life has yet to extend far beyond governmental agencies, the military, and some industries. e reason that many countries have replaced their traditional measurement sys-tems with the metric system is its ease of use and to improve international trade. ere are far fewer units to understand in comparison to the system commonly used in the United States. e metric system has only one base unit for each quan-tity and larger or smaller units are expressed by adding a preﬁx. e table below shows the base units in the International System of Units.QUANTITY BASE UNITLengthmeter (m)Masskilogram (kg)Timesecond (s)Temperaturekelvin (K)Electric currentampere (A)Luminous intensitycandela (cd)Molemole (mol)</bodyText><bookMarkId>164</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>164</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0165</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0165.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • APPENDIX E544Other international units appearing in Science and Global Issues are shown in the table below.QUANTITYUNITCOMMON EXAMPLETemperatureCelsius (°C)Room temperature is about 20° Celsius.Volumeliter (l)A large soda bottle contains 2 liters.Massgram (g)A dollar bill has the mass of about 1 gram.Electrical resistanceohm (Ω)Standard computer power cables have about .06 ohms resistance.Electric potentialvolt (V)A typical battery provides 1.5 volts.Powerwatt (W)One commonly used household incan-descent light is about 60 watts.Frequencyhertz (Hz)Humans can typical hear sounds from 20 to 20,000 hertz.Wavelengthnanometer (nm)Visible light is in the range of 400 to 780 nanometers. e International System’s preﬁxes change the magnitude of the units by factors of 1,000. Preﬁxes indicate which multiple of a thousand is applied. For example, the preﬁx kilo- means 1,000. erefore, a kilometer is 1,000 meters and a kilogram is 1,000 grams. To convert a quantity from one unit to another in the metric system, the quantity needs only to be multiplied or divided by multiples of 1,000. e chart below shows the preﬁxes for the metric system in relation to the base units.

Additional elements, called trace elements, are present in humans in very small amounts.The Big Four: C, H, O, and NApproximately 96% of the mass of all living matter, including humans, is made of just four elements—carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and nitrogen (N). ey are indicated in the periodic table on the following page in green. ese ele-ments are the building blocks of all biological macromolecules, which are the pro-teins, carbohydrates, lipids, and nucleic acids. Seven MoreSeven more elements constitute about 4% of the human body. ey are indicated in the periodic table on the following page in blue. Sulfur (S) is present in one of the amino acid building blocks of proteins, and phosphorus (P) is in both DNA and RNA, as well as in such molecules as ATP and NADPH, which provide energy for many reactions within cells. e elements calcium (Ca), chlorine (Cl), magne-sium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na) are generally present in small mol-ecules or charged particles called ions, and they play a number of roles in the human body. For example, calcium and phosphorus are important in bone strength, and calcium regulates many cellular activities, including muscle contrac-tion and cell division. Sodium and potassium ions are essential for nerve cells’ ability to transmit electrical signals.Trace ElementsLess than 0.01% of humans’ body mass is composed of trace elements, and scien-tists have not yet established their exact number or the roles that all of them play. You are most likely to be familiar with the biological role of iron (Fe), which is found in hemoglobin in red blood cells. You may also know that thyroid hormone contains iodine (I).

Over the centuries scientists have created and revised classiﬁcation systems by which to categorize and group living organisms. One system uses seven basic levels of organization. From largest to smallest they are: kingdom phylum class order family genus species Human beings, for example, are classiﬁed in the following way: kingdom: Animalia phylum: Chordata class: Mammalia order: Primates family: Hominidae genus: Homo species: sapiensNote that to designate the species of an organism, both the genus and species names are used. e genus name is capitalized, but the species name is not. Both words should be italicized. e correct format for the scientiﬁc name of humans is Homo sapiens.Scientiﬁc classiﬁcation was originally based on the work of Carl Linnaeus, who, in the 1700s, worked on grouping organisms based on their physical characteristics. Modern scientiﬁc classiﬁcation includes other information, such as organisms’ genomes, as scientists continually update the classiﬁcation of organisms when</bodyText><bookMarkId>168</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>168</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0169</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0169.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>548SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • APPENDIX Gnew information is discovered. As we have learned about the relationships among diﬀerent groups of organisms, the system of classiﬁcation has become more reﬁned, with the addition of such groupings as superorders and subfamilies that reﬂect new ﬁndings. In many instances currently, scientists are debating how to classify diﬀerent groups and organisms based on new information. Exact designations within the classiﬁcation system o en change, with scientists proposing diﬀering classiﬁca-tions for a group or a speciﬁc organism. Some of these proposed classiﬁcations are noted in the information that follows. Phylogenetics is another classiﬁcation system, based on evolutionary relationships rather than overall similarity.Domain ArchaeaKingdom Archaebacteria e Archaebacteria are single-celled prokaryotes with genes and metabolic path-ways that are more closely related to eukaryotes than they are to eubacteria. ey are found in a wide range of habitats (some of them extreme), including oceans, soil, marshlands, salt lakes, and hot springs. Examples: methanogens (Methanobacterium), which produce methane gas; ther-monacidophilic bacteria ( ermoplasma), which grow in environments with high temperatures; and salt-loving bacteria (Halococcus)Domain BacteriaKingdom Eubacteria e Eubacteria, single-celled prokaryotes, may be shaped as spheres, rods, or spirals. ey sometimes group themselves into chains or clumps. Some bacteria cause diseases, such as tuberculosis and strep throat, while others are beneﬁcial to humans, such as those with which we make cheese and yogurt.

Some are consumers, and others are producers. Phylum Ciliophora (ciliates)Characterized by hair-like cilia at some point in their development, almost all of these organisms use cilia for motility. Ciliates have two types of nuclei: a micro-nucleus, and a macronucleus. In most, genetic information is exchanged between cells through direct contact or by a bridge-like connection during a process called conjugation.Examples: Paramecium, StentorPhylum Apicomplexa, formerly known as Sporozoa (sporozoans)In sporozoans, disease-causing parasites, a group of organelles are located at one end, called the apical end. e organelles are involved in the interaction of the host cell and the parasite and the invasion of the host cell. e complex life cycle includes both sexual and asexual stages. Examples: Plasmodium, CryptosporidiumPhylum Dinoflagellata (dinoflagellates) e dinoﬂagellates are heterotrophic or autotrophic, and most have two ﬂagella. Most are marine, but there are some freshwater species. Some species are biolumi-nescent, some are parasitic, and some marine species are symbionts. ey repro-duce asexually. An algal bloom of dinoﬂagellates produces neurotoxins and forms what is called red tide.

A feature article summarizes recent studies on the eﬀectiveness of vitamin supplements and concludes that taking vitamin pills and liquids is a waste of money. A few pages later, an advertisement from a vitamin company claims that one of its products will protect you from all sorts of diseases. Such wide diﬀerences in claims that you will see in the popular media are common, but how can you tell which one is correct? “Media literacy” is the term that encompasses the skills we need to develop to eﬀectively analyze and evaluate the barrage of information we encounter every day. Media literacy also includes the ability to use various media to create and communicate our own messages.A strong background in the process of science helps you build two important skills of media literacy: being able to identify valid and adequate evidence behind a claim and evaluating if the claim is a logical conclusion based on the evidence. e skills share much in common with the process of scientiﬁc inquiry, in which you learn to seek out information, assess the information, and come to a conclu-sion based on your ﬁndings.Evaluating Media MessagesA “media message” is an electronic, digital, print, audible, or artistic visual mes-sage created to transmit information. Media messages can include newspaper arti-cles, political advertisements, speeches, artwork, or even billboards. e following are some of the kinds of questions you might ask as you learn to critically analyze and evaluate messages from various kinds of media. On the next page are three examples of media messages, all related to a common theme. Use these three examples to analyze and evaluate the messages. 1. Who created this message? Is this person an expert in the content of the message? What credentials does this person have that would make them an expert in this topic? Does this person have any conﬂicts of interest that may make him or her biased in any way? Who sponsored (or paid for) the message? Does the source of funding have any conﬂicts of interest? 2. What creative techniques in the message attract a person’s attention? Are there any sensational or emotional words, images, or sounds that grab the viewer’s attention? Do any of these words, images, or sounds try to stir up emotions and inﬂuence the viewer’s ideas?</bodyText><bookMarkId>188</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>188</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0189</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0189.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>SCIENCE &amp; GLOBAL ISSUES/BIOLOGY • APPENDIX I568 3. Does the message cite or mention appropriate sources of factual information? Does the author cite ﬁrst-person sources when reporting facts? Are the author’s sources from credible organizations? 4. Does the presented evidence completely support the claim? Might there be other information that could support or discredit the mes-sage? Does the author make logical inferences and conclusions from the evidence presented in the article?BAY MEDICAL JOURNAL e Monthly Journal of the Bay Region Medical Society Vol. XXXIV, No. 8Vitamin Z reduces severity of the common cold by 15%P.

Lowe, M.D., Mid-Bay Hospital, Director of Patient CareWilliam Ness, M.P.H., N.P., Mid-Bay Hospital, Director of NursingABSTRACT: IN A TWELVE-MONTH STUDY with 626 healthy male and female participants aged 21–36 and located in the general Bay region, the authors found that a regular dose of Vitamin Z appeared to reduce the severity of the common cold by 15%. In this controlled study, 313 participants received a placebo, and 313 participants received a 500 mg dose of Vitamin Z daily. The clinicians administering the dose did not know which patients were receiving the vitamin in this double-blind study. Over the twelve months, the participants averaged .9 incidences of illness each, defined as appearing to be rhinoviruses with general cold symptoms. Patients were asked to self-report about the severity, type, and duration of symptoms, using an assessment form. On the average, those receiving Vitamin Z reported less severe symptoms and shorter duration, by about 15%. The effects varied somewhat based upon the types of patients and the number of illnesses they experienced. Participants were requested not to use any other cold remedies or symptom relief during the occurrence, although compliance with this request was only 65%. Data analysis and graphs are provided, showing the aggregated results, and including estimations of likely margins of error.Are VITAMINS a WASTE of your money?HOME &amp; HEALTH Magazine SeptemberDonna S. was wondering if vitamins might give her the energy and good health that she felt had been slipping away ever since she had moved to Springfield with her family for a new job.SUZANNE BERYL WALKER</bodyText><bookMarkId>189</bookMarkId></page><page><spineIndex>189</spineIndex><spineIdRef>page0190</spineIdRef><pageRef>page0190.xhtml</pageRef><bodyText>MEDIA LITERACY569 5. Who is the target audience of this message? How is this message directed at this particular audience? 6. Is the message promoting certain values, lifestyles, positions, or ideas either directly or indirectly? Are there any positions or ideas that are being promoted that are not explicit in the message? Evaluating Internet SourcesImagine that you want to search the Internet to ﬁnd out about the eﬀectiveness of vitamin supplements so that you can come to your own conclusion. When you are searching for information online, a search engine is searching from over one trillion websites1. Determining which websites and sources of information are reli-able and which are biased is diﬃcult. To make an informed decision about this topic, you will need to identify accurate and unbiased websites. Below is a suggested list of questions that will help you determine if a particular website is an accurate and unbiased source of information. 1. Are the authors’ names, contact information, and credentials clearly labeled on the website? Accurate websites will usually contain information from knowledgeable authors who have their names, credentials, and contact information clearly labeled on the website. Some websites are managed by a collection of peo-ple or an organization, and information on the exact author may not be clearly stated. However, these organizations should state the names, con-tact information, and credentials somewhere on their website of the people who represent the organization. 2. Is the information and the website up to date? Some information that you may be seeking needs to be current. For example, if you were looking for the number of cars in the United States, you would want the most recent data. A study conducted in 1982 would not be helpful in this case. When seeking information that needs to be current, determine if the date the article or information was written is clearly indicated on the website so you can be sure you are accessing the most recent infor mation. Credible websites will usually indicate the date the article or information was created or last updated. Also, the person or organization maintaining the website should be regularly updating the website, so that the majority of links to other websites work. 1. Alpert, Jesse &amp; Hajaj, Nissan.

Authoritative websites will o en provide links to further information from other sources that support their claim. Authors of websites that contain information that is biased or inaccurate usually do not provide additional information that supports their claims. 5. What are other people saying about the author or the organization that produced this information? If you come across information from an author or organization that you are unfamiliar with, perform a search for other information about the author or organization. What are experts writing about the author’s or organization’s other work? 6. Why is this website on the Internet? Was this information put on the Internet to inform or to persuade people? Is the author selling something? What is the author’s motivation for pro-viding this information?FURTHER RESOURCESMarlene ier &amp; Bennett Daviss. (2002). e New Science Literacy.

Although science is certainly related to the accumulation and advancement of knowledge, it is much more than that. Sci-ence is a way of exploring and understanding the natural world. e National Academy of Sciences states that science is the “use of evidence to construct testable explanations and predictions of natural phenomena, as well as the knowledge generated through this process.” Scientists seek to answer questions but science cannot answer all questions, as some questions deal with phenomena that are not scientiﬁcally testable.According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), two of the most fundamental aspects of science are that the world is understand-able and that scientiﬁc ideas are subject to change. Scientists believe that the world is understandable because things happen in con-sistent patterns that we can eventually understand through careful study. Observa-tions must be made and data collected for us to discover the patterns that exist in the universe. At times scientists have to invent the instruments that allow them to collect this data. Eventually, they develop theories to explain the observations and patterns. e principles on which a theory is based apply throughout the universe. When new knowledge becomes available, it is sometimes necessary to change the-ories. is most o en means making small adjustments, but on rare occasions it means completely revising a theory. Although scientists can never be 100% certain about a theory, as knowledge about the universe becomes more sophisticated most theories become more reﬁned and more widely accepted. You will see examples of this process as you study the history of the sciences of evolution and genetics in this course. Scientific InquiryInquiry is at the heart of science, and an important component of inquiry is scien-tiﬁc investigation, including experimentation. Although scientists do not neces-sarily follow a series of ﬁxed steps when conducting investigations, they share common understandings about the characteristics of a scientiﬁcally valid investi-gation.

It is important for scientists to avoid bias in designing, conducting, and reporting their investigations and to have other unbiased scientists duplicate their results. Some types of investigations allow scientists to set up controls and vary just one condition at a time. ey formulate and test hypotheses, sometimes collecting data that lead them to develop theories. When scientists develop theories they are constructing explanations of the pat-terns and relationships associated with natural phenomena. ese explanations must be logically consistent with the evidence they have gathered and with evi-dence other scientists have gathered. Hypotheses and theories allow scientists to make predictions. If testing turns out to not support a prediction, scientists may have to look at revising the hypothesis or theory on which the prediction was made.

See also mRNA, protein synthesis.transport protein. A protein that carries molecules and ions into a cell or throughout the body. See also protein.tRNA. Same as transfer RNA.tuberculosis. An infectious disease, caused by a bac-terium, that mainly affects the lungs, but can affect other parts of the body. See also bacteria, disease. vaccine. A substance that stimulates an organism’s immune system to provide immunity to a speciﬁc disease.vacuole. A storage compartment in eukaryotic cells that is surrounded by a single membrane and that helps maintain homeostasis.variable. An element of an experiment or investiga-tion that can be changed independently of all other elements. vector. An organism that does not cause a disease itself, but spreads disease-causing microbes from one host to another. For example, rodent ﬂeas are vectors for bubonic plague, and female Anopheles mosquitoes are vectors for malaria.vesicle. A bubble-like cell compartment surrounded by a single membrane that carries materials to dif-ferent places in eukaryotic cells. virus. A microbe that must invade another cell in order to reproduce, composed of genetic material and a few proteins surrounded by a protein coat, and sometimes a lipid membrane.zooplankton. Plankton that derive energy from the food that they eat, often other plankton.
